page 45 today millions of people young

and old go into foreign countries every

year on business or for pleasure one can

see babies and baskets being taken about

by air every day that is a quicker way

to get about then on once mother's back

here is a woman who is carrying her baby

on her back she carries the child with

her wherever she goes in the last

hundred years people have learned to go

over land and see through the air as

almost all birds and many insects can

people are carried through the air in

airplanes

page 46 some birds have eyes which can

see great distances and they have good

hearing some of them can hear sounds

which we cannot hear but people have

made themselves new ears and new eyes

today one can talk with a person at the

other side of the earth by telephone

through the radio one can hear sounds

which come through space from thousands

of miles away one can see through a

telescope the mountains on the moon and

through a microscope thousands of living

things in a drop of water

page 47 hundreds of millions of people

today can see and hear on television and

the radio important statements by public

people statement which in earlier times

could have been heard by few it is a

question whether at any time in history

one has been able to be heard by

millions of people at the same time

without the telephone television and the

radio a person can only be heard as far

as the voice can carry new instruments

are making our homes less private and

public men and women more public no one

knows what will come of this one of the

worst effects is that singers who are no

singers and noise makers of every sort

can be heard in too many places

page 48 birds and many insects have

wings it is their wings which take them

up into the air the wings of birds have

long feathers on them their bones and

the stems of their wing feathers are

hollow this keeps them light here is a

bee here is a beetle here is a fly and

here is a butterfly bees beetles and

flies are insects there are many

different sorts of insects

page 49 people have been attempting for

thousands of years to make wings that

will let them fly like the birds here is

a picture of the first flying machine to

take men into the sky made in 1903 it

did not fly very fast or very far now

airplanes can fly farther and faster

than the fastest bird and can carry

heavy weights through the air people can

go faster than sound in the newest

planes

peach 50 we can see why distances

between people are not so important now

as they were they may be bridged in so

many ways what is a bridge here is a

wide river with a bridge over it the

bridge is more than a mile long and is

made of steel it can carry very heavy

weights it is so strong that not only

automobiles but trains go across it it

is so high the great ships go under it

language is a bridge between mines a

bridge so strong the trains of thought

can go across language can bridge

distances

page 51 language can bridge time as well

as space ideas can go from mind to mind

across the language bridge and they can

come from the past to the present we can

read what people before us wrote and

keep their books for others to read in

the future here are some of the great

books of all time books are the most

important records we have of people's

thoughts and feelings their ideas and

desires

page 52 all people have more in common

with all others on earth than most of

them know what - the words in common

mean what is their meaning what do the

people in this family have in common

they have their family name in common

they are the Smiths or the Wong's they

have a house in common it is their home

the husband and wife have their children

in common in some parts of the world

a man may have a number of wives in

other parts a woman may have a number of

husbands in these countries the Y's have

their husband in common or the husbands

have their wife in common people of the

same country have that country in common

it is their country every country has a

flag what is the flag of your country

page 53 people who talk the same

language have that language in common it

is their language the language of each

and all of them they have the ideas and

feelings about things which that

language carries people who do not talk

a language do not know what those who

use it are saying they do not know what

it's words can mean they have less in

common with those who talk it than those

people who have with one another

sometimes as in India in one country

under one flag people talk many

languages they have their country and

their flag in common but some of them

have to learn the language of others if

they are to have a language in common

page 54 talking with someone is saying

things to him hearing what he says and

taking in his meaning people can talk

together only when they have a language

in common when you were very young your

parents talk to you and after a time you

saw what they meant and learn to talk to

them a baby's first words are commonly

names for its parents some children

learn to talk earlier than others we go

on learning our language all our lives

some people talk more than they think

and some people think more than they

talk most of our thinking is done

through language

page 55 there are more than 6 billion

people on the earth and about 2,500

languages of these languages only about

12 are used by more than 50 million

people here are the names of some

languages which have very wide use

Chinese Mandarin and Cantonese English

French German Hindi Japanese Russian

Spanish Portuguese Arabic and Bengali

all these languages have more people

talking them today than ever before

200 years ago there were only about 20

million people who talked English for

example now there are more than 500

million and there may be many many more

page 56 more people will learn more

languages as better ways of teaching

them are worked out this book English

through pictures 3 is itself part of an

attempt to teach English better we need

better books to learn from and better

recordings of good voices to teach us

how to listen to the sentences of a

language and say them recordings of

sounds are made on CDs discs and on

tapes

page 57 we need good pictures to teach

us meanings in the new language and good

motion pictures to help many more people

to learn languages quickly and well the

learners will then be able to work in

groups with the help of teachers or by

themselves using books records radio CDs

sound motion pictures and television a

teacher can help a learner to learn

reading and writing can help us to think

page 58 writing is a very much newer

invention than talking nobody knows when

people first began to talk but they did

not begin to write so far as we know

until seven or eight thousand years ago

in Egypt Mesopotamia and China and later

in Palestine increase people begin to

make marks and pictures with sticks and

sharp stones from which others or they

themselves later could see what they had

thought

page 59 these early records were the

beginning of writing the first writing

was picture writing here are some early

Chinese picture words can you see what

they represent later Chinese writing is

less like pictures than the earlier

writing was but we can see the pictures

and some of its words for example here

are some Egyptian words and picture

writing

page 60 in picture writing each picture

represents a word you need a different

picture or mark for each word in

present-day Chinese writing most of the

marks are not pictures of anything and a

reader has to learn how the Chinese

write about 2,000 of these words before

being able to read a newspaper with some

of these marks you may be able to see

what the idea is for example the Sun and

Moon its meaning is bright and open a

man in two marks one of the meanings is

humanity learning to read Chinese is

much harder than learning to read

English but inward writing like Chinese

the same marks can be read as having the

same meaning in different languages for

example a Mandarin in Cantonese and in

Japanese

page 61 in time some people discovered

how to represent the sounds in words by

marks in any language there are only a

small number of different sounds by

writing down marks to represent sounds

not ideas people can spell any of the

words in a language with only a small

number of marks

every written language today has its

spelling system the hardest languages to

spell are those in which as with English

many of the letters may represent more

than one sound here is the complete

Roman alphabet in which English and many

other languages are written something

written in English has a meaning only if

it is read as English because the

letters in English represent English

sounds what is written in Italian must

be read as Italian

page 62 here is the name of the book

English through pictures written in a

number of different languages the names

of the languages are given in English

page 63 here are the 26 letters used in

English with the English names for them

spelled out after them some of these

letters are used not for one sound only

but for any of two or three or more

different sounds the letter A may have

the sound of aa in bag part again say

was any or fall the letter e may have

the sound of Ian Bell week older earth

or here or it may have no sound but only

an effect upon other sounds which come

before it the a and the G and bag have

different sounds from the a and the G in

age for example reading English is not

as hard as reading Chinese but it is

harder than reading a language in which

each letter has only one sound

page 64 are some of the sounds used in

one language very unlike any of those

used in another yes you may have felt in

learning English that some of the sounds

it uses are strange but if you do not

have a well-trained

ear you will not hear English words as

they are heard by an Englishman or an

American you will hear the nearest

sounds in your mother language a good

way of learning to make the sounds of a

new language is to use recordings which

has spaces after each sentence giving

you time to say what you have heard

before the next sentence comes

[Music]

page 65 there are machines which will

play back to you again and again one

after the other the sound you have made

and the sounds you were attempting to

make when you hear what you were doing

wrong you can try to do better next time

for most children new sounds are easy to

make when they hear them and children

seem to hear new sounds better and more

easily than grown-ups do if a family

goes to China or France or Finland to

take three countries whose languages

that are very unlike one another the

children will learn to talk Chinese or

French or Finnish much more quickly than

their parents will

page 66 why is this why is it easy for

young children to learn languages part

of the answer is that children have so

many needs they need to be helped by

grown-ups at every turn they have to

make their needs known and they are

always watching the effect of what they

say and try new ways of getting what

they want children are learning new

things all the time

page 67 another part of the answer is

that children are not as older people

sometimes are fixed in their ways of

living when they are taken from one

country to another they change easily

from one language to another from one

bed to another from one food to another

older people are more fixed in their

ways they have been hearing and talking

one language for a long time their ways

of hearing and making sounds and of

putting words together are like the

rails a train goes on they have been up

and down their lines of talk and thought

too many times to change them easily

children are freer in their ways they

are more like an airplane or better like

a bird they are free to go in any

direction they want they are free to

hear sounds as they are and make them as

they hear them they are free to put new

words together in new ways in talking a

new language

page 68 the more languages you hear and

get to know the more you will see how

any language is made up of a small

number of sounds put together in

different ways for example in English

light and write are different words with

only one sound in them different the

same is true of long and wrong if a

learner does not hear these different

sounds is different he may not get the

meaning of what is said to him

page 69 there are many ways of helping a

learner into a language but not enough

people know them most people learn their

mother language without being able to

give any account at all of how it works

they learn to talk as they learn to walk

without any idea of how they do it

people who learn to use a language well

do so through talking with others who

use it well through reading good writers

and through watching the effects on

others of what they say and how they say

it the world needs more people who can

use language well language is as

necessary to our minds as the air we

breathe is to our bodies

page 70 everybody needs air we breathe

in air from outside our bodies in every

breath when you put your face under

water you cannot keep it there long

swimmers can't swim underwater very long

they need air good swimmers may swim

with their faces in the water if so they

keep turning their heads to take a

breath through their mouths swimmers do

not take in air through their noses

under the water because water would get

in through the nose with the air and go

to the lungs with water in the lungs a

person can't go on living

page 71 here is a picture of a man's

lungs they are soft like sponges with

thousands of little pipes going through

them the pipes keep branching like the

branches of a tree so that they go

through every part of each lung our

lungs are in the upper part of our chest

we have two of them the air we breathe

goes right into every part of the lungs

through these branching pipes they take

it to the blood which is moving all the

time through the lungs and round to

every part of our bodies the blood makes

a journey round the body and back to the

lungs in a very short time

page 72 what is blood it is the red

liquid which comes out of your finger

when you cut it there are about 13 pints

of blood in a person's body we can give

a pint of blood at a time to a blood

bank for the use of others who may need

it a healthy body makes up the pint of

blood quickly what does our blood do for

us it takes food to all parts of our

bodies and takes waste away from them

all the parts of our bodies are made up

of cells these cells which are very

small all need food all the time

page 73 here are some cells thousands of

times the size they are in the body each

different sort of cell has its own work

to do

different from the work other sorts of

cells do no one had seen cells before

the invention of the microscope and its

development in the 16th and 17th

centuries before then no one could make

pictures of cells because no one could

see them

page 74 cells are like little flames a

flame needs food we get a quick flame

for a fire or a cigarette by lighting a

match or using a lighter the flame of

the match burns the match and the flame

of the lighter burns the liquid in the

lighter if there is air for them to burn

in all fires burn something what they

burn is their fuel fuel is food for fire

page 75 the blood is like a stream the

cells take what they need their fuel out

of the bloodstream as plants and fishes

take their food out of the water the

bloodstream carries food and the oxygen

which it has taken up in our lungs to

all the cells in the body old cells die

and give place to new cells in the body

as plants and fish and other living

things in the world about us die and

give place to others three million of

your red blood cells die every second

and other cells take their place the red

cell population of your body changes

completely in about three months

page 76 what makes the blood go on

moving around the body in a stream the

heart sends it round the heart is

between the lungs a person's heart is

the size of his shut hand the heart is a

pump if you put your hand under water

like this and keep letting the little

water into it and sending it out again

you are pumping the water the heart

pumps blood in a way a little like this

page 77 the heart has four rooms in it

with doors valves between them it pumps

blood in and out through these doors by

changing the size of the rooms so that

the door is open and shut it can do this

because it is made of muscle the heart

keeps a stream of blood going all round

the body and back again to itself the

pipes which take blood from the heart

are named arteries the pipes through

which it comes back to the heart are

named veins

page 78 a solid line represents an

artery and a broken line a vein

page 79 the first man to discover that

the blood goes to all parts of the body

althrough the valves of the heart

through one system of pipes and back

again

through another was the 17th century dr.

William Harvey the journey of all our

blood all round the body is the

circulation of the blood as you see in

the picture opposite the branches of the

arteries are like the branches of a tree

which get smaller and smaller the

farther they are from the roots the

small branches go to all parts of the

body they go to the ends of your fingers

and toes to all the muscles those parts

by which you move your arms and legs and

head and other parts of the body

pjt everywhere the bloodstream does two

things

supplies the cells with food and oxygen

and takes away waste it is if the blood

kept the little fires in the cells

burning and took away the ashes the fuel

for the fires in the cells is given us

by the food we eat it cannot burn

without oxygen this gas is as necessary

to all living things as it is necessary

to the burning of fires made of wood or

coal burning is a change which takes

place when oxygen and fuel unite coal

wood and other fuels cooking gas for

example burned by taking oxygen from the

air

page 81 when you see someone opening a

window in a room full of people you know

that is to let in air from outside as

good air comes in through the window

bad used air with more carbon dioxide

and water in it and less oxygen goes out

we say good air is fresh air fresh air

is clean and good to breathe and has

enough oxygen in it for our needs

page 82 these boys are outside in the

fresh air breathing deeply while their

teacher is saying in out for every

breath which they take if you could

watch them you would see their chest

becoming first larger then smaller in

size as their lungs breathe air in and

out breathing goes on when we are awake

and when we are sleeping most of the

time we are not conscious of our

breathing the motion of our lungs as we

breathe is automatic it goes on by

itself the lungs taking fresh air in and

letting used air out about 18 times a

minute this is the common rate of

breathing we become conscious of our

breathing if anything shuts the air off

from us so that we do not get enough

oxygen for our needs

page 83 keeping your mouth shut

take your nose between your thumb and

one finger so that you shut the air out

and shut your breath in how long can you

hold your breath you will be wise if you

do not try to hold it more than a minute

if oxygen is kept from a person for long

he will become unconscious when people

become unconscious through getting water

or smoke in their lungs it is very

important to start them breathing again

this is done by turning them face down

putting something between their teeth to

keep their mouths open and then working

their lungs to start them breathing

[Music]

page 84 the higher up we go

the less is the pressure of the air

because the weight of the air above us

is less as the pressure becomes less air

gets thinner the amount of oxygen we get

in one breath becomes less we must take

in more air to get the same amount of

oxygen the instrument we use to measure

the pressure of the air is the barometer

page 85 men have been able to get to the

top of the highest mountain in the world

Mount Everest they had to use oxygen

when they got up high they had to keep

control over the amount of oxygen they

used they could get no more supplies

from those below this man who is going

up a high mountain is using the supply

of oxygen which is stored in those cans

he is carrying on his back by opening

and shutting a valve he controls the

amount of oxygen he breathes in the gas

has been pumped into the small space

inside the cans it is under pressure in

there and comes out when the valve is

opened
