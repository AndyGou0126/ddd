page seven here are some people who live

in the United States of America the USA

the fathers and mothers of these people

went to the USA from England France

China Japan Italy Switzerland Poland

Russia and other countries some of them

sailed there in sailing ships before the

days of steamships now the sons and

daughters live in the USA and most of

them are Americans

some of them were born in the USA they

got their start in America that they

have many relations in the old country

page eight Japan and India and China are

parts of Asia Germany Italy and France

are in Europe in all these countries

there are many people in some countries

there is very little land for the size

of the population Europe has less land

than Canada and not much more than the

USA but it has a population more than

fifteen times as great as Canada's and

the numbers keep going up between 1850

and 1950 more than 30 million people

went from Europe to live in the USA but

the population of Europe in 1954 was

greater than the populations of North

and South America together

page 9 there were 25 million more people

in Europe in 2004 than there were 50

years before the increase in population

in 50 years was 25 million Europe

increased her population by 25 million

in the last 50 years today there are

over 475 million people in Europe this

map gives a picture of the number of

people in each country of Europe in 2004

page 10 this is a picture of the

increasing population of the United

States in only 100 years one person in

the picture represents 20 million people

this picture is a graph this graph lets

us see relations between times and

numbers of people in the 100 years from

1900 to 2000

page 11 this map gives a picture of the

population in the different states of

the United States of America in 2000 the

scale of the map is the same as that

used for Europe on page 9 if you look at

the two you will see that the USA is not

much smaller than all of Europe

page 12 which are the countries with the

most people in them China India the USA

in Indonesia all have populations of

over 200 million some countries have

less room in them than these four but

these have the greatest populations it

is not good for a country if it does not

have enough room for all its people a

person who does not have enough room to

live in may not be able to keep well

page 13 the population of the earth has

increased more than the amount of food

there is a great need for more food more

than a billion people on the earth today

need more food than they can get they

cannot get enough food to keep them well

and strong the relation between amount

of food and size of population has been

changing

page 14 there were more than twice as

many people in the world in the year

1900 as in 1700 there were more than

twice as many in 2000 as in 1900 with a

population of the world go on increasing

look at the curve in this picture the

increase since 2000 makes it look that

way the world population in 2004 was six

billion three hundred ninety-six million

in the last four years the increase has

been almost three hundred million

page 15 there were over 6 billion 100

million people in the world in 2000 over

1 billion of them could not get as much

food as they needed many of them because

of this are not healthy there are some

people everywhere who take more food

than is good for them but many more get

less than they need people are asking

one another what the world population

will be in 2050 if it goes on increasing

like this it will be very great it will

be much greater in some parts of the

world than in others some people say it

will be between nine and ten billion and

some that it may be as much as 20

billion

page 16 over half a billion people on

earth today live in cities

some cities have many more people in

them than some countries have there are

over 100 cities in the world which have

over 2 million people in them cities

have been increasing in size in our time

before the 20th century it was hard for

the people in a great city to get enough

food on the next page you will see the

names of 20 cities in the world with

more than 3 million people in each

page 17 cities of the world with

population of over 11 million in 2004

300,000 today more than half the

population of the world is made up of

people living in great cities

page 18 this city has great buildings

some of which have machines in them for

doing many sorts of work by steam or

electric power these are factories one

of them is a factory where furniture is

made in it workers make tables and

chairs and great numbers

peach 19 we are living at a time when

machines do work which workers used to

do now materials and things of all sorts

can be transported long distances

quickly its transport lines are very

important to any great city materials

such as iron which is mined from the

earth in some places and steel which is

made from iron are used to make machines

iron and steel or metals

page 20 it is only in the last two

centuries the great numbers of people

have been able to live far from their

food supply with thousands of people in

one place doing the same sort of work

high buildings like those pictured on

the next page are being put up in more

and more great cities today in greater

and greater numbers they are apartment

houses which sometimes have hundreds of

different families living under one roof

there may be as many as 20 or 30 floors

in one apartment house with homes for 15

or 20 families on a floor

page 21 hundreds of families may make

their homes in one apartment house in

these stores people who live in the city

can buy food clothing and supplies of

everything they need some stores sell

food some sell clothing and some sell

furniture in most cities there are great

stores which sell almost everything they

supply these families with what they

need

page 22 people in apartment houses have

no place to keep a supply of food they

may have enough food in an icebox to

take them through a day or two

but on most days they buy meat and milk

and fruit and other things they need

from a store near their home many

families have supplies of milk and other

foods sent to their houses every day

people with children in the family may

buy four or five quarts of milk at a

time here is a family with five persons

in it a husband a wife and their three

children the man is the woman's husband

and she is his wife they have been

married 10 years

page 23 a milkman put the milk outside

their door in the early morning

milkman started their work in a great

city before it was light

in some parts of the world milk is

measured in gallons milk is put up in

pint and quart bottles or in cartons in

other parts of the world

milk is measured in liters a leader is a

little more than a quart

page 24 in some factories food is put

into cans it is canned these are

machines in a canning factory most foods

today can be bought in cans food stores

sell canned soups meats fruit and

vegetables food is can to keep it from

the air when air can get at it it

quickly goes bad if it is not kept very

cold canned food that is gone bad is a

poison bad food is very bad for people

it poisons them if they take much of it

they may die after a person dies he is

dead

page 25 people can have only a few cans

of meat and fruit and other things on

hand as we say on their shelves they may

have a cupboard with two or three

shelves of canned food but most people

have no room for more than that

if supplies do not come into the city

day by day their supply of canned food

is quickly used up many solid and liquid

foods are kept in cans gas for cooking

can be canned and piped to the gas

cooker from the can for use

page 26 some people working in cities

have no time or place to cook for

themselves many of them go out to

restaurants for all of their meals there

are many restaurants in a great city

all needing supplies of food every day

and some of them cooking for great

numbers of people a good restaurant

keeps its food clean and does not let

flies get at it

if flies get on food they may poison it

page 27 here is a supply of meat

vegetables milk butter cheese bread

fruit and eggs enough for a family of

four persons for one day in North

America if people do not get enough food

of the right sorts they will not keep

well they will not be able to work or

play well fresh food must be supplied to

a city day by day it will not keep good

very long if it is open to the air if

uncovered it make it flies on it flies

get on dirty things their dirty feet

make food dirty canned food will keep

good for a long time it can be stored

page 28 grain and meat and milk and

fruit and vegetables must be transported

into the cities of the world day and

night all through the year to feed its

city populations much of this food comes

great distances and ships trains or

trucks and must be kept cold and

cleaning all the way today some of it is

transported by plane this is a bag of

grain

page 29 the 19 million people in and

near New York City in 2004 to give one

example we're drinking 7 million quarts

of milk a day for more than a million

cows on 50,000 farms some of them

hundreds of miles away the price of a

bottle of milk in the city is more than

twice as much as the farmer gets for it

the milk must be kept clean and cold and

put into bottles and taken to the stores

and houses in the city city governments

see that milk is kept clean and has

enough butter fat in it some city born

children have never seen a cow and have

to be taught where milk comes from

peach xxx milk is the best food there is

for babies it is good for children and

for older people too it has in it fat

which gives energy and it has the most

important of the materials needed for

building up our bodies

milk makes strong bones and strong teeth

too it is good for a child to drink two

or three glasses of it every day

in addition bill Kazon at most of the

vitamins which are needed to keep us

healthy vitamins are a discovery of the

20th century two hundred years ago no

one knew anything about them

page 31 the vitamins are named by

letters of the alphabet vitamin A is

needed by the eyes there is vitamin A in

milk butter and green vegetables it can

be stored by the body vitamin B cannot

be stored it must be supplied all the

time by some of the food we eat the

skins of grain of all sorts have vitamin

B in them

peach 32 vitamin C is very important to

the body without it our teeth become

loose and our arms and legs weak lemons

oranges and tomatoes have vitamin C in

them vitamin D is the Sun vitamin we get

it in milk and eggs and from sunlight on

our skin there are other vitamins but

these a B C and D are the most important

peach 33 every person must have air and

water and food to keep alive and must

have these vitamins to keep well how do

we know this how do we know what food

keeps us well and healthy we know from

the effects on us

and on animals of going without one sort

of food or another that is how we see

which foods give us energy which make us

fat and which make us able to keep

healthy

scientists are putting together more and

more knowledge about the sorts and

amounts of food that our bodies need to

little food or too much of the wrong

food is bad for a person the right

amount of the food will keep a person

feeling well and strong some people need

a little more or a little less of one or

another sort of food than others

page 34 where do we get our food we get

much of it from the earth we use some

sorts of animals and birds to give us

food great parts of the earth are

covered with grass a plant which grows

with narrow green leaves and puts down

roots quickly there are more than 3,000

different sorts of grasses growing grass

has very small seeds which are used as

food by birds and small animals we have

discovered how to grow grasses with

larger seeds wheat rice corn and other

grains come from grass the green lands

of the world have been planted by people

from grain we get an important part of

the food that gives us energy

page 35 the grasslands of the earth

supply food to many different animals

from some of them we get meat and milk

from milk we make butter and cheese and

other foods from birds living on grain

we get eggs and meat seeds planted in

good earth supply grains and fruits and

vegetables of many sorts the season

rivers supply fish and some sea plants

for food

page 36 people had to go from place to

place for food until they discovered how

to grow grain uncooked meat and parts of

plants were all they had to eat until

they made use of fire and they had to

get new supplies of food every day they

hadn't any way of keeping it good how

could a family get enough good food for

itself without having to go looking for

it every day when a family started

growing grain it had time to do other

things than get food day by day it could

keep a supply of green on hand through

the winter until the next spring it

could make a home for itself and keep

animals for its use

page 37 bread which is made from flour

supplies us with energy and is the chief

food of many people a small amount of

seed planted in the earth can grow great

amounts of good grain a good farmer in a

good wheat growing part of Canada for

example will get as much as 30 or 40

pounds of grain for every pound of seed

he puts into the earth farmers grow

grain for public use they get money for

it in eastern countries more rice is

eaten than wheat

page 38 if there were enough good food

in every country every day for every

person would the world be a better place

than it is we say if there were enough

food not if there is enough food because

there is not enough and we know it we

say if there were something in this hand

you would see it because we know that

there is nothing in the hand but with

this hand which is shut we say if there

is something in this hand you will see

it now the hand is open there is

something in it and you do see it

page 39 if we ask the question if there

were enough good food for everybody

would the world be a better place

some people would answer yes the world

would be a better place others would say

no nobody would do any work the world

would be a worse place and some others

would say something like this that is a

strange question to ask when so many

people in the world today do not get

enough food there will be time to answer

your question when we have grown enough

food for everybody what would your

answer be

page 40 why do people work do they work

only for their private needs because of

their need for homes and food and

clothing for themselves and their

families why do some people work when

they have enough of all these things do

they work for pleasure because making

things for example gives them pleasure

do some of them work for the public good

why are some people happier when they

are working isn't work one of their

needs why do you work do you need to

work to be happy do we know one

another's needs aren't we in the dark

about some of them

page 41 if all the people alive on the

earth today were hand in hand like this

the line they would make would go much

more than 50 times around the earth the

line of people would go out to the moon

and back five times it would be long

enough to do that

but there isn't a line of people which

goes out to the moon and back and the

people of the earth aren't hand-in-hand

far from it that is why we said were not

are and they would go not they go we say

if the angles in this triangle are equal

then the sides will be equal but we say

if the angles in this triangle were

equal the sides would be equal

page 42 people are not hand-in-hand but

their minds today are being put

increasingly into touch with one another

through reading and writing and in many

other ways we are in touch with other

people everywhere through pictures of

them newspapers and television give us

photographs of almost everything the

faces of important people can be seen by

the public everywhere before 1800 nobody

could take photographs nobody had had

the idea of using the knowledge of how

light is bent by glass to make pictures

here is a camera which is taking a

picture of a man you will see that the

picture inside the camera is upside down

[Music]

page 43 another way in which people are

getting to know more about one another

is through the radio words were first

sent from one place to another by

telephone more than a hundred years ago

a word can now go by telephone from the

Atlantic to the Pacific in 1/12 of a

second a telephone needs wires but the

radio which came into use almost 100

years ago can send sounds any distance

without wires television TV which is one

of the great new powers for good or bad

of our time let's a public person talk

to millions while they sit in their

private home seeing the person as if

standing right there in front of them

page 44 but people can't know what any

person is saying if they don't know the

language up to a hundred years ago few

people needed to learn foreign languages

because not many people went into

foreign countries now the need to learn

other people's languages is becoming

greater every day
