page 81 this is a scale a scale is an

instrument for measuring weight which

man's weight is greater they are on the

scale the weight of the Thin Man is 100

pounds the weight of the fat man is 200

pounds clocks are instruments for

measuring time this is a watch watches

and clocks are instruments for measuring

time this is an instrument for measuring

heat a yard measure is an instrument for

measuring distance inches feet yards

meters and miles are measures of

distance

page 82 all bodies have an attraction

for one another if the bodies are great

the attraction between them is great if

the bodies are small the attraction is

small if the bodies go farther from one

another

the attraction gets smaller here is a

light here is a square it sends out

light in every direction

I put the square at different distances

from the light at distance one it gets

all the light which is going out between

the lines a distance two it gets 1/4 of

the light at distance five it gets 125th

it is the same with the attraction

between bodies

page 83 what keeps the moon up in the

sky why does not the moon come down the

moon is a great body its weight is great

the earth is a great body its weight is

81 times the weight of the Moon 2 times

3 is 6 the moon and the earth are not

very far from one another the distance

between them is about two hundred and

thirty nine thousand miles because they

are great bodies and near one another

the attraction between the moon and the

earth is very great why does the moon

not come down to the earth that is a

question

page 84 the answer is because it is

going round the earth this is a chord in

my hand the chord has a weight at its

end the weight is hanging down on the

chord which is in my hand I make the

weight go round on the chord I keep the

end of the chord in my hand now I let

the end of the chord in my hand go the

weight goes off in a straight line it

takes the chord with it

page 85 the pull of the court in my hand

kept the weight from going off in a

straight line the attraction between the

earth and the moon keeps the moon from

going off in a straight line the moon

goes round and round the earth month

after month

it does not get farther from the earth

or nearer to the earth

it keeps about the same distance from

the earth

page 86 here is Sir Isaac Newton the

great man of science Newton had a great

mind he is under an apple tree it is the

year 1666 those are apples which are

over his head the seat has three legs

here is an apple which was over his head

the Apple was on a branch of the tree

the Apple came off the branch it came

down it came down on Newton's head

page 87 that is the story the story may

be true or it may not be true but that

is the story it comes from the great

writer Voltaire true two plus two equals

four that is true

two plus two equals five that is not

true it is a false statement apples are

fruit that statement is true apples are

animals that statement is false in this

story the fall of the Apple on Newton's

head was the cause of the idea the blow

which the Apple gave to Newton's head

gave an idea to Newton it made a

question come in to Newton's mind this

was the question have the fall of the

Apple and the motion of the Moon the

same cause

page 88 here is a ball it is hanging on

a cord I will give a blow to the ball

with this stick I gave the blow now the

ball is in motion what was the cause of

the motion the blow of the stick was the

cause of the motion the ball was not in

motion before the blow it was at rest it

was hanging on the end of the cord the

blow is the cause of the motion after

the blow the ball was in motion the

motion came from the blow the motion was

the effect of the blow

page 89 which of the statements on this

page are true and which are false put a

tea before the true statements and an F

before the false a one the earth is in

motion true - the earth is turning round

true 3 the earth goes round the moon

false B 1 the moon is greater than the

Sun false - the Sun is colder than the

moon false 3 the moon goes around the

earth true

see one the attraction between two

bodies gets greater as they go farther

from one another

Falls to the attraction between two

bodies is greater when they are nearer

true three when two great bodies are

near one another the attraction between

them is small false d1 when a blow puts

a ball in motion

the blow is the cause of the motion true

- when a blow puts a ball in motion the

motion is the effect of the blow true 3

when a body is in motion it is at rest

false

page 93 what is this the man has an

umbrella in his hand it is open he has

it over his head why because it is

raining water is coming down from the

sky the water is rain rain is coming

down rain is falling it is raining the

rain made the man put up his umbrella

that was the effect of the rain today is

Monday yesterday the Sun was bright

there were no clouds in the sky today

there are dark clouds in the sky they

come between us and the Sun the dark

clouds keep the light of the Sun from us

page 94 the rain comes down from the

clouds on me he comes down on my head

the rain comes down from the clouds on

us it comes down on our heads why is it

raining today yesterday the weather was

good the sun was bright the air was warm

today the weather is bad the rain is

coming down the wind is blowing it is

cold and the rain makes us wet

h95 tomorrow the weather may be worse it

may be very cold all the water may be

ice snow may be coming down making

everything white well tomorrow be like

this is this winter or summer or

tomorrow the weather may be better the

Sun may be bright again the air may be

warm again and the streets may be dry

again well tomorrow be like this

peach 96 what are the causes of these

changes in the weather change what is

that here is a line here is a change in

the direction of the line this bird was

wet it was in the rain now it is dry

that is a change it was wet it is dry

what is the cause of these changes in

the weather why are there these changes

of weather there is not one cause only

there are numbers of causes changes in

the heat which comes to us from the Sun

are one cause of changes of weather

page 97 the amount of heat which the

earth gets from the Sun is different

from time to time there are changes in

the Sun if you take a look at the Sun

through a bit of dark glass you may see

small marks on the face of the Sun

amount one dollar is a small amount of

money a million dollars is a great

amount of money a drop of rain is a very

small amount of water there is a small

amount of water in this glass there is a

great amount of water in the sea this is

the sea those are shifts which are on

the sea

page 98 changes in the heat which comes

to the Earth from the Sun our one cause

of changes in the weather this discovery

is new a man of science made the

discovery in 1944 he made it by

measuring the heat which comes to the

earth every day from the Sun the amount

of heat is different from day to day on

some days the Sun sends more heat to the

earth on other days it sends less heat

to the earth there is more water in this

glass than in that we are making new

discoveries every day Columbus made the

discovery of America in 1492 Columbus

came to America in his ship in 1492

[Music]

page 99 what were some other great

discoveries one of them was fire fire is

a very great use to us it gives us heat

another great discovery was the wheel

wheels are round they go round a cart

they are a very great use to us

another great discovery was clothing

what are these these are some other

sorts of clothing the making of cloth

was a great discovery this is how we

make cloth these are threads they go

across from one side to the other of a

frame

eh 100 these are other threads they go

across the first threads they go under

and over them this is cloth this is a

roll of cloth we make clothing of cloth

we make cloth of threads we make threads

from wool and cotton and silk we get

wool from sheep wool is the thick warm

hair of sheep we take the wool off the

sheep's back with scissors

peach 101 we make threads from the wool

by twisting the hairs round and round

that will is going round it is giving a

twist to the thread it is twisting the

thread we get cotton from the cotton

plant cotton is a soft white hair round

the seeds of the plant these are

different sorts of seeds plants come up

from seeds which come from other plants

of the same sort we get silk from the

silkworm this worm makes a soft strong

thread of silk and puts it round itself

like a coat

page 102 wool cotton and silk are

different sorts of cloth we make

clothing of all these sorts of cloth

when the weather is cold we put on thick

warm wool clothing when the weather is

warm we put on thin cotton clothing

cotton clothing is not as warm as wool

clothing that clothing keeps us warm it

keeps us warmer than thin clothing thick

cloth keeps air in it between the

threads the air does not let heat go

through it a thick roof keeps the heat

of the house in a thin roof lets the

heat go through it a thick roof keeps

the heat of the Sun out

page 103 here is a pencil it is straight

it is not bent here is a glass of water

I put the pencil in the water the pencil

seems bent where it goes into the water

the pencil is straight but it seems bent

it seems like this but it is like this

it is straight not bent it seems bent

not straight

page 104 before I put the pencil in the

water

it seems straight it was straight after

I put it in the water it seemed bent it

wasn't bent when it is in the water it

seems bent when it is out of the water

we see that it is straight why did it

seem bent when it was in the water this

is a light a light sends out light the

light which it sends out goes in

straight lines here is a bit of glass a

ray of light is going through the glass

eh 105 where the light goes into the

glass it is bent it is bent again where

it comes out of the glass into the air

here is your eye you are looking at the

pencil in the glass of water the life

and the pencil is bent where it comes

out of the water into the air it is bent

here the pencil is not bent but the

light from it is bent

page 106 the light comes from here but

it seems to come from here the part of

the pencil which is under the water

seems to be where it is not here is your

eye the light from the pencil is bent

here it comes out of the water here the

point of the pencil seems to be here it

is here the light is bent where it comes

out of the water

peach 1:07 this is a looking-glass what

do you see in the looking-glass I see a

girl's face in the glass she is looking

at herself in the glass what does she

see in the looking-glass she sees

herself in the glass she seems to be

here she is here she is on this side of

the glass she seems to be on the other

side of the glass why because the glass

sends a light back there seem to be two

girls in this picture there is only one

h108 what is this man doing he is

working with the Spade that is his work

what is this woman doing she is working

with her needle that is her work what is

this man doing he is making shoes he is

the shoe maker that is his work these

are shoes these are boots

he makes boots and shoes that is his

work

page 109 what is this man doing he is

putting paint on the door he is painting

the door he is a painter that is his

work

this is his paint this is his brush

he puts the paint on with his paintbrush

this is addition the boy is doing

addition that is his work this is a bank

this is a check

page 110 we keep money in banks banking

is an important sort of business men and

women in banks and business houses keep

accounts this is an account keeping

accounts is an important part of

business keeping accounts is one sort of

work

these are account books farming is

another sort of work this is a farm

page 111 this is a cart this is a plow

the plow is turning up the earth this is

a field the farmer is plowing the field

that is part of his work as a farmer the

farmer has an account with his bank he

puts his money in the bank

he keeps money in the bank he gets money

from the bank the account says how much

money he has in the bank

farming and keeping accounts are two

different sorts of work

page 112 what sort of work is this man

doing he is cutting wood what sort of

work is this woman doing she is washing

stockings and dresses what sort of work

does this man do he keeps a store

it is a fruit store he is a store keeper

what sort of work does this woman do she

keeps a house it is her house she is a

housekeeper

page 113 but your fingers across one

another like this I have my first and

second fingers across one another across

these two lines go across one another my

second finger is over and across my

first finger these are finger nails did

you put your fingers across one another

that is right you have your fingers

across one another

now take a pencil and give a touch to

one finger and then a touch to the other

and then put the pencil between them

do this with your eyes shut

page 114 you will have a strange feeling

our two pencils touching your fingers or

is only one pencil touching them do you

have the strange feeling that two

pencils are there when you are touching

one finger only you seem to be touching

the other why is that here is the answer

when the two fingers are like this or

like this they do their work together

but when they are across one another

they do not do their work together then

attached to one sometimes seems to be a

touch to the other

eh 115 what is there work what do the

ends of our fingers do their chief work

is touching those fingers are touching

the cover of a book touching gives us

knowledge when our eyes are shut or when

we are looking in another direction or

when we are not able to see we get

knowledge through touching and feeling

with our fingers

peach 1/16 the chief work of the ends of

our fingers is touching here is a man

who is not able to see that is a Braille

book which he has before him he is

reading the book with the ends of his

fingers Braille letters and words are

like this he is touching them with the

ends of his fingers this other man is

reading with his eyes he is not reading

with his fingers what did those things

on his nose they are his glasses

page 117 what is the work of the eyes

seeing their work is seen what is the

work of the ears hearing their work is

hearing what is the work of the legs

walking walking is their chief work what

is the work of the mouth is talking or

taking in food the chief work of the

mouth I say this this is talk

what is the work of the hands taking

things up putting them down getting

things giving things making things we do

things with our hands
