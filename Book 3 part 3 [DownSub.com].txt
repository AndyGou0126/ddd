page 86 it was more than a century after

Harvey had discovered the circulation of

the blood the two other scientists one

English and the other French discovered

oxygen these men saw that when a flame

burns it takes something out of the air

that is why a candle goes out when it

has been burning for a little time in a

small amount of air it has taken all the

oxygen out of the air you may see this

by putting a lighted candle under a

glass cover so when the candle is used

up the oxygen from the air it cannot go

on burning it cannot burn without oxygen

it's light goes out so with the burning

that goes on inside the millions of

cells of our bodies if the blood stops

carrying oxygen to the cells they go out

they die

page 87 when we are running our hearts

are working much harder than when we are

sitting down our blood is being pumped

more quickly through our bodies the

blood must carry a greater supply of

oxygen to the muscles all over the body

our hearts work for us automatically our

heart can pump as much as three thousand

gallons of blood a day the amount pumped

at any time is controlled automatically

after running hard we breathe very

quickly because while running we

couldn't take in enough air for our

oxygen needs we are out of breath as we

say

peach 88 our bodies control themselves

in many other ways for example the

temperature of our bodies and those of

all warm-blooded animals is controlled

our blood temperature is kept at 98.6

degrees Fahrenheit or near it when a

person is very ill some of the automatic

controls of the body stop working the

temperature measured by a Fahrenheit

thermometer may go as high as 103

degrees Fahrenheit or 104 degrees

Fahrenheit but if it goes much higher or

keeps as high as that for very long one

cannot go on living but will die

page 89 if you have a high temperature

you will feel unwell then it is good to

go to bed and send for your doctor you

may have to go to a hospital a nurse is

taking this patient's temperature he has

had a bad cold and has been in bed for a

day he felt unwell his temperature went

up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit but it is

down again the nurse is looking at the

thermometer which she put under the

man's tongue he has kept it there with

his mouth shut for two minutes

the man's temperature is 98.6 degrees

Fahrenheit that temperature is right for

a healthy person

page 90 the body is many different ways

of keeping itself warm enough and not

too warm it uses up more food more fuel

for the cells in cold weather it shivers

that is its muscles go on making quick

little motions to keep it warm we cannot

stop ourselves from shivering the body's

heating system is not under our

conscious control it is automatic to

stop shivering we have to warm ourselves

some other way we may run or walk

quickly or take hot drinks or cover

ourselves up warmly or use hot water

bottles to warm our beds

page 91 our bodies give off some of

their heat all the time by sending a

little liquid out through the skin

sometimes the amount gets greater and

her skin becomes wet this cools the body

quickly here the man on the left is

shivering because he has been waiting in

line for a long time in the cold wind

the man on the right is wet all over

because he got too hot in the Sun he is

drinking water because he feels the need

of it he is thirsty

page 92 this man is in training he is

going to run a distance of 1 mile in the

shortest possible time the fastest

runners before him have taken a little

under 4 minutes and he wants to make a

new record when a man runs a mile in 4

minutes he is going at a rate of 15

miles an hour but it is not possible to

keep running at this rate very long the

runner is standing now in front of his

doctor who has an instrument in his hand

through this the doctor can hear the

sounds made by the runners heart

page 93 now the doctor is taking the

man's pulse he has his finger on the

man's wrist and is counting the times

his heart pumps the blood in one minute

the doctor can feel the motion or

pulsing of the blood every time the

man's heart pumps in most people the

pulse rate is between 70 and 80 times a

minute in children it is higher the

runner's pulse rate is 72 it will be

higher when he is running

page 94 there is a good story about the

use the great Italian scientist Galileo

once made of his knowledge of the pulse

rate

Galileo lived 300 years ago before

people had watches for measuring time in

the sixteenth century there were very

few clocks in the world and no watches

one day when Galileo was a young man of

eighteen he was in the great Church of

the city of Pisa where he lived

watching the motion of a light hanging

down on a long chain from the roof high

above his head he saw that as the light

moved forward and back on its chain it

seemed to take the same time between

turns however far it went

page 95 to see if he was right about the

motion of the light

Galileo put his fingers on his wrist he

timed the motion of the light as it went

forward and back on its chain measuring

it by his pulse rate he was right he had

the proof he could prove that the time

was the same however short or long the

journey of the light through the year

was Galileo had made a great discovery

about the motion of a pendulum among

other things this discovery made

possible a better instrument for

measuring time the pendulum clock

peach 96 measuring how fast something is

moving gives us the rate of motion this

plane is gone 300 miles in half an hour

its rate was 600 miles per hour this man

has walked two miles in half an hour

he was walking at a rate of four miles

an hour now he is standing he is not

moving this man is working slowly his

pay will be small if he is paid by the

amount of work he does in a day this

other man is working quickly his pay

will be high if he is paid by the amount

of work done in a day the two communist

ways of paying a worker are by the hour

and by the amount of work done piece

work is work paid by the amount done for

different sorts of work rates of pay may

be different

sometimes rates for the same sort of

work are different in different places

page 97 in different countries different

sorts of money may be used in the USA

and Canada people are paid in dollars in

the UK they are paid in pounds the rate

of exchange between the USA dollar and

the pound in 2004 was about $1 76 cents

to 1 pound you can exchange a pound for

$1 76 cents

here are some other rates of exchange

they are for the business week

August 16th through August 20th 2004 a

table of exchange rates is printed in

the newspaper

peach 98 when we move about from one

country to another we sometimes have to

change our money we sometimes have to

change our watches and sometimes we

change both when we change our watches

we move the hands forward or back

forward if we are going east and back if

we are going west

here is a map giving time lines across

the Pacific Ocean in the days when

Galileo used his pulse as a timekeeper

most people did not even know that the

earth was round they knew no more about

the journey of the earth around the Sun

than they did about the journey of their

bloodstream through their bodies

peach 99 but 2,000 years before Galileo

there were Egyptians and Greeks who knew

more than a little about the motions of

the Sun and stars and the angles between

them at different times some few Greeks

even knew that the earth is not flat as

it seems but round like a ball one of

them even said that it was about twenty

five thousand miles round which it is

and that the earth moved around the Sun

while turning on itself it is from the

Greek language sometimes through Latin

and French that many of the words used

in science have come for example

peach 100 but for another 2,000 years

most people went on thinking that the

earth was flat like a large plate with

the Sun and stars

journeying round it how was the idea

that the earth is not flat but round

like a ball proof true in the end

sailing men went out in their ships to

find a way by water from Europe to India

and China though some ships from the

north of Europe had sailed west to parts

of America in the 10th century most of

Europe had no knowledge of the land

across the Atlantic men like Marco Polo

had gone East to India and China much of

the way by land long before Columbus in

1492 went sailing west with the idea

that he could get round to the Far East

by water

page 101 Christopher Columbus has gone

down in history as the man who

discovered America he was looking for a

way of getting to the east by sailing

west it was hard for him to get help for

this journey he was laughed at by most

people when he said he could go this way

to India because the earth was round

this is the sort of ship Columbus sailed

in he made use of a half-hour sandglass

for measuring time at sea through all

the long months the glasses on Columbus

three ships had to be turned every half

hour as the sand ran out

page 102 people living in America were

named Indians by Columbus because he

thought he had got to India when he

discovered America he went back to Spain

without knowing that he had found a new

continent he knew nothing of the life

that had been going on in North and

South America for thousands of years or

of the two great peoples the Aztecs and

the Incas who had been living there the

one in Mexico the other in Peru for

centuries it is now thought that in 1500

the population of the Americas was about

30 million and that the first of these

Indians had come from Asia themselves

there may have been a land bridge

between Asia and Alaska across which

they could have come

page 103 30 years after Columbus

discovered America the ship of Magellan

a sailor of Portugal was the first to

make its way south of South America and

on round the world through the Indian

Ocean and past the Cape of Good Hope

back to Europe Magellan himself died on

one of the Philippine Islands on April

27th 1521 when his ship sailed out to

the west and came back home from the

east three years later people could see

that the earth must be round this proved

that the earth was round it was proof

enough for most people

page 104 but it was harder to take in

the idea that the earth might be moving

round the Sun as Copernicus of pollen

1473 to 1543 said it was very few people

had made any sense of the writings of

Copernicus by the time he died in 1543

21 years before Galileo and Shakespeare

were born few people could read or write

in those days it was Galileo who made

the first telescope through which he

could watch the Stars and look into the

ideas that Copernicus and others had

been working upon through his telescope

the star see more than 30 times as NIR

and he could see not only the mountains

of the moon but spots on the face of the

Sun and the motion of the moon's moving

round the planet Jupiter

page 105 Galileo could let people look

through his telescope but he could not

make most of them see the picture of the

universe that was becoming clear in his

mind he could not do that anymore than

Copernicus had been able to do it

people's ideas were changing but not as

quickly as his Galileo was put in prison

for saying that the ideas written down

by Ptolemy 1,500 years before did not

make sense to him

page 106 Newton who was born the year

that Galileo died took the new line of

thought much farther like Galileo he

became a great watcher and recorder

asking the question how more than why an

answering by measuring and recording and

comparing and proving even more than

Galileo he saw the universe as part of a

great machine and he was able to put

into words great natural laws accounts

of its workings

page 107 he was able to do this only

because he was carried forward on the

shoulders of such men as Galileo Kepler

and Copernicus with their work before

him he could think out new ideas about

the weights of things and their motions

his law of gravitation says that all

things in the universe have an

attraction for one another it was only

by standing on Newtons and other

scientists shoulders that Einstein was

able to get his picture of the universe

and work out new ideas about time and

space and energy their work made it

possible for him to see farther into the

laws of the universe than they could

younger scientists in their turn are

developing new ideas made possible by

Einstein

page 108 the thinking of scientists has

become clearer and truer as their

instruments have become better Galileo

made one of the first microscopes as

well as the first telescope and by the

middle of the 17th century this new

instrument had opened up another world a

world of things too small for our eyes

by themselves to see the microscope made

possible the discovery of the cell

structure of all living things even the

human body could be pictured now as a

great machine with millions upon

millions of working parts each part a

cell

page 109 together with all this new

knowledge of the cell structure of

plants and animals the microscope opened

up a world of living being so small that

people had no idea such things were

possible it was a surprise to the

scientist to see that in a drop of water

there might be thousands of living

things of many different sorts moving

about and taking in food with the

invention of such instruments as the

microscope and telescope people found

themselves walking between two strange

new worlds one too far off and great the

other too near and small for anyone but

the scientists to know much about or do

much about as science developed thinking

people came to feel less and less at

home in the universe they had enough

knowledge to be conscious of the need

for more

page 110 our bodies can be looked upon

as machines which are kept going by fuel

as food is burned up in the body cells

it gives us heat and other sorts of

energy all through our lives from birth

to death we must be supplied with energy

even when we are sleeping we are using

up some food to keep our bodies warm our

lungs and heart keep on working some

animals sleep through the cold winter

weather snakes for example when they are

asleep the rate of breathing and pulse

rate and temperature go down unless food

is needed only animals that can store

enough fat in their bodies to keep them

alive through the winter can sleep

through the months when food is hard to

get

page 111 while our bodies are at rest

the large muscles are not in use it is

these large muscles which pull on our

bones and let us move as we want to hard

work with our large muscles uses up

energy quickly so that we come to feel

hungry and want to eat the more we know

about the parts of our bodies and their

work the more new questions come to our

minds questions such as how is it

possible for all the different parts of

us to grow from one cell how is it

possible for all the millions of cells

and our growing bodies to go on doing

what they do without our being conscious

of their workings

page 112 through about two billion years

scientists say the development of plants

and animals on our earth has been going

on at first both were very small much

less than a pinpoint in size we might

say that the first plants or animals

were bodies living in one room house

--is too small for the eye to see all

the housekeeping went on in one room

such cells take food in and let waste

out they do not give birth to new cells

but divide to become two daughter cells

these three pictures show the division

of the cell into two separate cells each

of which may in turn divided into two

more

page 113 the earth itself is thought to

be more than twice as old as life on it

our picture of what it was like two

billion years ago is of a great ball

about as hot on its surface as boiling

water in time as the Earth's surface

became less hot the thick clouds rounded

from which water went on raining down

got thinner then more sunlight could get

through to the surface of the earth

sunlight is necessary for life on earth

as air and water are

page 114 life began people think in the

salt sea near the land where the waters

were not deep very small one celled

organisms came into being the cells in

our bodies are of many different sorts

but they all have water in them our

bodies are 70% water this water has in

it about the same amount of salt common

table salt as there was in the water of

the sea in which the earliest organisms

swam that water was a little less salt

than seawater is today in billions of

years the rivers have washed down more

and more salt from the land into the sea

the sea has become more salt the water

in our bodies does not become more salt

even if we eat a great amount of salt in

our food the body automatically controls

how much it will keep in the bloodstream

and the same is true if we let very much

salt out through the skin when we get

overheated then we have to eat something

that will give us new supplies of salt

eh 115 the first living things though

they were too small to be seen we're

eating growing organisms which divided

to become others like them under a

microscope a cell looks like a bit of

clear jelly with a thin wall around it

very small openings in the walls of the

cell let food in and waste out in every

cell there is a part like a little ball

this is the nucleus which organizes the

work of the cell those cells were

discovered two and a half centuries ago

it is only in the last hundred years

that knowledge of the work of the

nucleus has developed it is this nucleus

which keeps the cell working at what has

to be done it is to the cell what London

is to Britain New Delhi to India Beijing

to China it is the seat of government

page 116 all living things are

developments from these one celled

organisms they have developed step by

step through change upon change from

these first simple living things our

bodies and the bodies of the plants and

animals we see about us are highly

complex in their structure they have in

them millions of millions of cells some

doing one sort of work some another

every different cell has its own sort of

work to do what do the words simple and

complex mean

peach 117 the greater the number of

parts a thing has the more complex it is

the smaller the number of parts of thing

has the simpler it is which of these is

the more complex the more different the

parts of the thing are from one another

the more complex it is the last

different the parts of the thing are

from one another the less complex it is

which of these is more complex

page 118 the more the parts of a thing

need one another the more complex it is

take one little wheel out of a watch for

example and see if the other parts can

do their work without it which is more

complex a stone or a plant the leaves

the flower stem and roots of the plant

work together to keep it alive but each

does a different sort of work and each

is dependent upon all the others the

work of each part is different the parts

of a stone do not work in this way for

one another a stone is a much simpler

thing than a plant any living thing

however small or simple it may seem is

far more complex than anything which has

no life

peach 119 people are the most complex of

all organisms far more complex than any

plant we would not go on living but

would die if the millions of millions of

cells in our bodies did not work

together in their different ways each

doing its own sort of work the cells are

dependent upon one another and we are

dependent upon our cells the picture

below shows what the word dependent can

mean the girl in the middle is dependent

on both men to keep her from falling the

man who has been holding her feet is

letting go as the other man takes hold

of her hands she has been dependent on

the first man she will be dependent on

the second their act depends on timing

page 120 there are about five million

red cells in one cubic millimeter of our

blood one millimeter is a thousandth

part of a meter and a tenth of a

centimeter one cubic centimeter how much

space does that take up here is a

picture of a cube which is one

centimeter long one centimeter wide and

one centimeter high it takes up one

cubic centimeter of space a centimeter

is a little less than half an inch

page 121 you can put a paper cube this

size together for yourself or cut one

out of soap or cheese to make a paper

cube take a pencil and make six one

centimeter squares like this now take

your scissors and cut round the outer

lines do not cut the broken lines but

make faults there put the edges together

to make a hollow paper cube as in the

picture your cube will be a cubic

centimetre in size a cube has six sides

its size are equal squares the surface

of a one centimeter cube is 6 square

centimeters in one cubic centimeter of

our blood there are about five billion

red cells
