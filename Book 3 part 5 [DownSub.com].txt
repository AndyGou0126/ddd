peach 160 air travel would have seemed

very strange two or three thousand years

ago to man keeping their sheep on the

mountainsides all these changes are the

outcome of the great step taken in the

invention of numbers before men could

count how did anyone know which were his

sheep and which were another man's he

put his mark on the sheep he was their

owner they were his own sheep he owned

them sometimes he gave his sheep names

and then he would go through all the

names with his sheep to see if they were

all there

page 161 before the invention of writing

how did people keep records they made

pictures on soft earth or sand but rain

and wind and waves quickly washed away

such records smooth stone or wood was

better and best of all the smooth stone

walls of caves whose roofs kept the rain

and wind away it may be that the

drawings copied on page 142 or others

like them were records made by early

humans someone recording animals on a

cave wall may have taken pleasure in the

drawing for itself and become the first

artist

page 162 how did a man know how many

sheep he owned sometimes he used small

stones or sticks putting one of them

into a bag or pocket for each sheep he

had when he came to the end of his sheep

the number of stones in the bag was the

same as the number of his sheep the

stones and the sheep were equal in

number the stones gave him a record of

how many sheep he owned when his sheep

died he could take a stone out of the

bag and when the Lambs were born he

could put in another stone for each lamb

peach 163 sometimes a record was made by

taking a sharp hard stone and making

cuts on a stick the number of cuts in

the stick equalled the number of things

to be recorded

then the stick was cut in half down the

middle so that each half had half of

every cut on it the two half sticks were

tallies if they were put side-by-side

the house of the cuts came together they

tallied one man took one tally and

another the other and both then had the

record

page 164 tallies are some of the

earliest and simplest records of the

numbers of things they tell how many

things have been counted even today in a

bank a person who takes money in and

gives it out is sometimes named a teller

the Shelford table where the teller

works as a counter on it the teller does

the counting of the money coming in and

going out and keeps a record of all this

in an account book a person who makes a

statement tell something most banks make

a statement every month to each person

banking with them to tell them what

their account is the statements tell

them how much money they have in the

bank at that date then both day in the

bank have the record straight to get

these statements ready the banker has to

take the amount of money given out from

the amount of money put in

[Music]

page 165 bank tellers must keep a

complete record of the money they take

in and give out this is their way of

making certain that their accounts are

in order banking is a very important

sort of business a bank must keep all

its accounts in good order and the

statements which the bank makes must be

true statements

peach 166 how do we know whether someone

is telling the truth if a man tells

another that he will give him 3 bags of

grain for one sheep the other will know

whether he told the truth when he gets

the grain or doesn't the man may or may

not have meant to give the grain when he

said he would he may not have meant to

say anything but the truth but if he did

not give the grain later he was not true

to his word we sometimes know whether a

man is telling the truth by the look in

his eye or the sound of his voice

pitch 167 in early times before people

invented money they did all their

business by exchange of goods people

traded with others by exchanging goods

they were willing to give up for goods

they wanted more exchange of things

still goes on in some parts of the world

today after the invention of money trade

increased it is our experience that

money can be a great help in making

trade easier and in keeping business in

better order if you want something and

have the money for it you can buy it you

do not have to keep asking yourself

whether you have something which the

other person will be willing to take in

exchange for what you want

peach 168 early people did things with

their hands which we do with instruments

or by machine fingers were made before

forks among their early uses fingers

made good counters we still use the

number 10 as the key to our number

system because we have 10 fingers many

people today still count on their

fingers and others use an abacus an

abacus is a frame with little balls

threaded on wires the balls are pushed

from side to side on the wires the

invention of the abacus made it possible

for the balls on one wire to represent

the numbers up to 10 on the next wire

tens up to a hundred the next hundreds

and so on

peach 169 the most important number in

the number system used commonly today is

zero zero is so easy to use that it is

hard to understand why it was not

invented long ago

it is thought to be not much more than a

thousand years old and no one knows who

invented it we use zeros to change

numbers to others zero to the right of a

number makes it ten times its size to

zeros make it a hundred times its size

six zeros after one make it mean 1

million schools today teach a child to

add subtract multiply and divide numbers

here are examples

peach 170 people made their way about on

the earth over mountains down rivers and

across seas long before they had a

number system or could make her use a

compass nobody knows who invented the

compass the Chinese Arabs Greeks and

Italians among others

say they did when people became able to

work out the relations of lines and

spaces to one another and could measure

distances and angles the science of

geometry earth measuring began people

went on then from measuring fields and

bits of land to measure the size of the

earth itself

page 171 the Greek scientist errata

Singh's was the first man to work out

the size of the earth he heard that

there was a deep well into which on one

day of the year the sun's light went all

the way down to the bottom

he took the angle of the Sun at the same

hour from another place 500 miles from

the well and worked out by geometry that

the earth was about 29,000 miles round

the size of the earth scientists now

tell us is about 25,000 miles round

page 172 geometry starts with ideas

about lines and spaces here are two

circles in two squares the circle on the

left is inside a square that is the

relation of that circle to that square

the square on the right is inside a

circle that is its relation to the

circle these are facts about the circles

and squares on this page statements

which tally with facts are true

statements which don't tally with facts

are not true it is untrue that the

square on the right is outside the

circle to say it is would be to make a

false statement

page 173 what is a circle it is easy to

see what it is but not equally easy to

say what it is here is a straight line

half an inch long if you could turn the

line right round like the hand of a

watch it would have covered a circle one

end of the line would have to keep in

the same place while the rest of the

line was turning here is another line

the same length it is half an inch long

if you could pull it down like a map on

a roller a distance equal to its own

length then it would make a square with

sides half an inch long this is not a

square though its sides are equal why

not because it's angles are not right

angles this is not a square though its

angles are right angles why not

because its sides are not all equal

page 174 6,000 years ago in Egypt there

were people who saw how to measure their

land through their knowledge about

squares and triangles how large is this

square what is its size because the

square is on squared paper it is easy to

see what its sizes we count the number

of small squares in the large square

this number is the area of the square if

the small squares were an inch square

the area of the large square would be 16

square inches if they were one foot

square the area of the large square

would be 16 square feet if they were one

yard square the area of the large square

would be 16 square yards whatever the

unit of measure used the relation of

side to area is the same

page 175 people took the first units of

long measure from their bodies the end

of a man's thumb is about one inch long

a tall man's foot is about 12 inches or

1 foot long a long staff is about 3 feet

or 1 yard long the simplest way of

measuring a short distance is to step it

these units of long measure have been a

great help to us they have made it

possible for us to measure and compare

lengths and areas and volumes measuring

lets us build a room the size and shape

we wanted for example 20 feet long 16

feet wide and 12 feet high

page 176 sometimes a family's fields

were not square some of them were like

this or like this people walked across

their fields they planted them and took

in the grain they knew how much land

they had from working them before they

could measure them they saw that a field

like this was the same size though not

the same shape as a field like this

before they knew that they could measure

how long and wide a field was and then

get the area by taking one measure times

the other

peach 177 they saw that they could get

half a filled in this way or in this way

before they knew how to measure

rectangles or triangles can you see

whether these two fields of the same

area put in lines to prove that they are

or are not equal in area the answer is

at the bottom of page 178

page 178 here is a right-angled triangle

the two shorter sides are three and four

units long how many units long is the

longest side

can you tell without measuring how about

2500 years ago a great Greek Pythagoras

proved that the square on the longest

side of any right-angled triangle is

equal to the squares on the other two

sides added together we can use his

discovery to get our answer we multiply

the length of each of the two shorter

sides by itself we get the answers

together then we find a number which

multiplied by itself gives us this

number

eh 179 here is the answer when we

multiply a number by itself we square it

any number is the square root of its

square five is the square root of 25

page 180 it was not until many centuries

later that people put this knowledge of

geometry to wide use the development of

science had to wait until the days of

Galileo and Newton in the last three

centuries our ways of living have been

and are being deeply changed by science

these changes can be compared only with

three or four great earlier steps in the

history of human development these are

the birth of language the use of fire

and farming and the invention of writing

here is a horse walking round and round

the mouth of a well he is pulling on a

strong stick of wood which is kept

turning by his motion this moves a chain

with buckets on it the motion of the

chain carries buckets full of water up

and takes empty buckets down the horse

has a cloth over his eyes to keep him

from seeing that he is walking all the

time in a circle would he stop if he

knew he was going round in circles

page 181 today machines are the

workhorses they are doing what people

gave all their days to doing in the past

muscles get less tired in the machine

age but they often get more tired in

other ways we are finding that we need

more and more time to work out the

direction that our lives may best take

we need a new design for living people

carried water from Springs and rivers

and pulled it up by hand from wells long

before they learned even how to turn a

chain round a wheel

they put a cord round a wheel and turn

the wheel round because that was less

hard work than pulling full buckets up

the well by hand the steps have come

slowly because each has to be taken

before the next a next step was to put

another bucket on the other end of the

cord so that an empty bucket went down

as the full one came up

peach 182 in one of the well-known Uncle

Remus stories Brer Rabbit a little

animal who always gets the better of the

other animals living near him gets into

a well bucket and down he goes to the

bottom of the well as his bucket goes

down the other bucket comes up empty how

am I ever going to get back up he says

to himself after a while Brer Fox comes

along looking for Brer Rabbit what are

you doing down there Brer Rabbit he says

looking down into the well hole

page 183 I'm doing a little fishing

there are hundreds of fish down here how

can I get down there says Brer Fox just

get in the bucket Brer Fox it'll bring

you down in no time says Brer Rabbit and

as the Fox goes down up comes Brer

Rabbit to the top in his bucket as he

wanted to do the two buckets go by one

another on the way

good day Brer Fox some go up then some

go down a happy landing to you says Brer

Rabbit with the smile and a wave of the

hand such stories about animals are as

old as any inventions

peach 184 here is a water wheel being

turned by water power the weight of the

water falling into the buckets turns the

wheel and the wheel in turn turns great

round stones for crushing grain and

making it into flour men took their

grain to the Miller to be made into

flour then they took the flour away and

their wives made it into bread people

did all this everywhere in the old days

before the invention of steam engines

and electric power

page 185 here is a windmill which does

the same sort of work the wind pushes

the sails of the windmill round the work

of the windmill is dependent upon wind

when there is no wind the Miller cannot

make flour because there is no power to

turn the mill stones around there is an

old song about a Miller who lifts by

himself and could be heard singing the

song all day long I care for nobody no

not I and nobody cares for me sing the

Miller what he meant was that he did not

love anyone and that nobody loved him he

had no hopes or fears he did not hope

for anything or fear anyone

page 186 in many parts of the earth the

climate is either too hot or too cold

for humans most of the year but it is

now possible to put automatic controls

over temperature into houses offices and

work plants here is a thermostat which

keeps the temperature of the air as high

or low as we want we put the pointer at

70 degrees Fahrenheit then the

thermostat will keep the temperature of

the room near 70 degrees Fahrenheit the

point on the scale to which the pointer

points

page 187 a thermostat is designed for

this purpose its design makes use of our

knowledge of what metals do when heated

this is the way it works different

metals get larger by different amounts

as they are heated to long thin pieces

of such different metals are bent

together like this inside the thermostat

when the temperature in a room goes

above 70 degrees Fahrenheit the metal on

the outside gets longer than the metal

on the inside this moves the arm to the

right and shuts off the fuel in the

heating system of the house

peach 188 when the room gets too cold

the piece of metal on the outside gets

shorter and moves the arm to the left

this turns on the heating system and

more fuel is burned to warn the house

the purpose of putting a thermostat into

a heating system is to control

temperature in hot climates what is

important is to cool houses by sending

fresh cold air through them we can

control the temperature of the rooms and

in addition dry the air and have a

climate of our own making indoors every

ice chest has a climate of its own

inside it it is strange and surprising

but true that ice chests are kept cold

by using heat the heat is supplied by

electric power or by burning gas

scientists tell us that before long we

will be using the sun's heat to cool

buildings this will make life in hot

climates much easier

eh 189 there are many other sorts of

automatic controls in this hotel a door

is automatically opening to let a man go

through his body is shut off the light

from an electric eye as he walked past

it in this Bank a bell is ringing loudly

because someone has touched a window

the man was hoping to break into the

safe many offices banks stores and work

plants are kept safe at all times by

such automatic Watchers

peach 190 here is a night watchman in a

motion picture studio keeping it safe

from danger of fire at night he has his

time clock with him he walks all night

long through the plan from one station

to another at each station he pushes his

time clock against a key which is fixed

in the wall this key prints a number on

a long narrow roll of paper which is

moving all the time through the lock of

the time clock in this way the time

clock makes a full record of whether and

when the watchman went to each station

in the studio in turn the time at which

he was at each one of them is recorded

if a number is not recorded that is

proof that the watchman did not go to

that station

page 191 this record is necessary before

the insurance company will pay for

damage done to the plant by fire the

insurance company needs to know where

the watchman was all through the night

the motion picture company pays

insurance money every year to the

insurance company in exchange the

insurance company will pay for any

damage to the building done by fire but

the motion picture company is

responsible for keeping the studio as

safe as possible from fire the night

watchman with this time clock is part of

the system of keeping the studio safe

from fire

peach 192 here is a more fully automatic

part of a system of controls against

fire some metals meld at low

temperatures for metals thin lengths of

such metal are placed at many points in

the plant a fire starting near one of

these points will quickly melt the metal

this starts an electric system working

it opens outlets through which water

comes down from the ceiling to put out

the fire the price is such a system may

be high but it is much lower than the

price of a new building such insurance

is cheap at the price

page 193 much of the work in present-day

factories has to be automatically

controlled the much talked of assembly

line was a first step in this direction

it lets us make automobiles and many

other things much more cheaply than they

could be made before an assembly line is

a moving line of parts of whatever is

being made each worker does one thing to

each automobile as it goes by the work

of each is dependent on what has been

done before they are parts in an overall

design with an overall purpose if you

make workers into machines for short

working hours you can free the rest of

their time what for to what purpose

what are we designed to do this new free

time has been given us by the workers

and thinkers of the past we have to

think about what we will do with it and

about the best possible use of it

peach 194 it seems sometimes as if we

want very much to put an end to waiting

on one another there are many ways for

example of making the serving of food in

restaurants more or less automatic one

of the causes of the high price of food

in restaurants is the use of waiters and

waitresses one waitress can serve only a

small number of people if she has to go

to and from the tables with trays and

fewer people than before are interested

in doing this sort of work even when

that hours are short the pay is good and

the work is not too hard in present day

living more people than ever before eat

at restaurants many families who used to

have servants now do all their own

housework

peach 195 there are ways of making

restaurant self-serving that is of

getting the public to do more of the

work so that fewer waitresses are needed

and less time is wasted and waiting to

be served the nearest thing to complete

self serving is the automat food and

drink are put into boxes with glass

doors in front you look at the food if

you want what you see you put in the

right amount of money and the door is

unlocked so that you can open it you

take the food out and shut the door

again fresh supplies of food are put in

the boxes as they are emptied

page 196 more and more use is being made

in public places of automatic machines

which sell food cigarettes drinks stamps

or even books to make buying and selling

simpler and more automatic is important

too many people have to give up too much

of their time to shopping for their

families

some of them use up a large part of

their lives going from shop to shop to

get what they want and waiting in line

for people to serve them serving

themselves frees them from this

page 197 there are great food stores

today where every sort of food meat

bread butter milk vegetables flour sugar

salt fruit whatever it may be is put out

each in its place on shelves for

everyone to help themselves you take

what you want put it in a little cart if

there is much of it and take it to a

control counter where you pay for it an

automatic adding machine is used to give

the amount you will have to pay and to

make a record of the things you have

bought the adding machine prints the

price of each thing on a roll of paper

you see how much you are paying for each

thing you are buying and how much what

you have bought adds up to then you get

a list of the amounts recorded and the

store keeps a copy these records of

everything sold help to keep the

business of the store in order
