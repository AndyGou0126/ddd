page 121 seeing and hearing and touch

are three of our senses we get knowledge

through our eyes seeing through our ears

hearing and through our fingers touching

these are three of our t senses another

sense is taste this is a man's tongue

these are his lips

this is his chin the chief work of the

tongue is tasting here is some white

powder on a plate

it may be salt or it may be sugar which

is it salt or sugar

she is tasting the powder she is some of

it on her finger she's putting some of

the powder on her tongue she is tasting

it

page 122 we get salt from the sea the

water in the sea has salt in it we get

salt from salt mines some mines are deep

they go far down into the earth we get

sugar from plants we get it from the

stems of some plants we get sugar from

the root of some plants the salt or

sugar which we put in our food is a

white powder

page 123 the taste of sugar is sweet

this is a cake it has white sugar on the

top cakes with sugar on them are very

sweet this is an orange this is its skin

some oranges are sweet but the taste of

their skin is bitter Saul has a salt

taste sugar has a sweet taste to the eye

salt and sugar seem the same but to the

tongue they are very different their

taste is very different

peach 124 what is the work of the nose

what do we do with our noses she has a

flower in her hand she is smelling the

flower some flowers have a sweet smell

some flowers have no smell this is grass

these flowers are in a garden they have

a sweet smell these are pigs some pigs

are dirty some pigs are clean the smell

of dirty pigs is not sweet it is a bad

smell this is smoke this is a fire some

smoke has a good smell the smell may not

be sweet but it may be a good smell he

is smoking a pipe is a smell of the

smoke good

page 125 we see things with our eyes and

we see their colors here are some names

of colors green blue white red yellow

gray what is the color of grass and

leaves in spring grass and leaves in

spring are green what is the color of

this girl's lips her lips are red the

sky is blue it is blue when it is clear

the color of some clouds is white other

clouds are gray the Sun is yellow some

times when it is going down or coming up

it is red this flame is yellow

page 126 we see things with our eyes we

see the sizes and colors of things

sometimes things seem to our eyes

greater or smaller than they are they

are not what they seem

this man is tall this man is short this

is a tall woman this is a short woman

here are two men do they seem the same

size which of them seems taller does the

man who is farther seem taller than the

man who is nearer the pictures of them

are the same size the lines in the

picture make the man who is nearer seems

shorter

page 127 seeing hearing touch taste and

smell are the five senses but we have

more than five senses which are some of

the other senses our sense of how warm

or how cold things are is another here

is some cold water with ice in it it is

very cold here is some water in a kettle

the water is boiling steam is coming out

of the kettle

here are three basins the basin to the

right has very warm water in it the

basin to the left has cold water in it

the basin in the middle has water which

is not cold and not warm in it

page 128 I put my hands in the basin's

at the sides one of my hands is in the

cold water the other is in the warm

water I keep them there for a time now I

am putting them together into the middle

basin where the water is not cold and

not warm what is this

this water seems warm to one hand and it

seems cold to the other it is the same

water but it seems cold and warm at the

same time why is this it is because one

hand was in warm water and the other in

cold water before I put them in this

middle basin

page 129 another sense is our sense of

motion here is a seat which goes round

and round a man is in the seat he is

going round and round at first he has a

feeling that he is in motion he has the

feeling that he is going round the seat

with a man in it keeps on turning round

at the same rate it does not go quicker

it does not go slower after a time the

man has a feeling that he is not in

motion but there is no change in the

rate at which the seat is turning it is

going round the same number of times a

minute

page 130 after a time if the rate of

turning is the same the man seems to

himself to be at rest he is like all the

men and women on the earth we are all

turning round all the time with the

earth but we seem to ourselves to be at

rest we have no feeling that we are in

motion this is because the rate of

turning is the same the man is in motion

he seems to himself to be at rest

here are three boys and a dog two of the

boys are taking a rest they are resting

on their beds the other boy in the dog

are in motion

page 131 now put a stop to the motion of

the seat when you do that the seat is at

rest the man is not in motion but he has

a feeling that he is turning round and

round this is a picture of his feelings

he is not turning round but he seems to

himself to be turning round and

everything around him seems to be

turning round why is this it is because

change in our motion is the cause of our

feelings of motion through our sense of

motion we get knowledge of changes in

the rate and direction of our motion

page 132 what is he doing he is

hammering this is his hammer these are

nails of different sizes he is putting

the cover on a box he is nailing down

chord is fixed to a tree and the boy has

the other end he is shaking it up and

down with every shake he sends a wave

down the cord to the tree as the wave

goes down the cord this part which was

up goes down and this part which was

down goes up

peach 135 these are ways in the air they

come to our ears

they have effects in our ears and brains

those effects are sounds here is a brain

the part of the brain which does the

most work in hearing has the word

water in them this cup has some water in

it this bucket has more water in it the

sea has the most water in it some

peach 138 she is looking at herself in a

looking-glass again and again every day

she takes a look at herself in a glass

the woman beautiful was Lisa herself

beautiful that is not certain I have my

idea of that he has his idea

she had her idea we may have different

ideas of how beautiful that woman was

there is no measure of the beautiful

eh 144 she may or may not be beautiful

but it is certain that she has a smile

on her lips that is certain it is not

certain that she is beautiful two plus

two equals four two and two are equal to

four that is certain two plus two equals

five two and two are not equal to five

that is certain it is certain that two

plus two equals four a is equal to B and

B is equal to C and C is equal to D so a

is equal to D things which are equal to

the same things are equal to one another

things which are not like one another

may be equal or they may not these two

are like one another but they are not

equal

peach 145 a smile is like a laugh but a

laugh makes a sound

this girl is laughing she is happy she

has a fall she gives a cry now she is

crying she is not laughing now she is

crying why because she gave her Nia blow

in the fall this is her knee she was on

desire for the ball which will he go to

if his desire for the cat is stronger

than his desire for the ball he will go

to the cat he went to the cat his desire

for the cat was stronger all our desires

are for things which seemed good to us

they may not be good our ideas of them

may be wrong

page 149 we get knowledge by putting

questions that is one way of getting

knowledge the answers may give us

knowledge or they may not when the

answers are right they give us knowledge

when they are wrong they do not give us

knowledge two plus two equals four right

two plus two equals five wrong how far

is the Sun from the earth which is the

right answer it is two miles away or it

is much more than two miles away which

is the wrong answer to the question

which is his right hand which is his

left hand he is facing you now he has

his back to you which is his left hand

now and which is his right

page 150 our senses seeing hearing

touching tasting and smelling our ways

doorway the way into the room is through

the door the way out of the room is

through the door which is the way to the

station take the first Street to the

right this man had no knowledge of the

way to the station now he has knowledge

through our senses through talk with

others through the work we do with our

hands and our heads and through books

these are all ways of getting knowledge

knowledge is very important it is

important in itself and it is important

as a way to other things a person who

has no knowledge is of no use to others

is the word use part of your knowledge

of English knowledge gives us light it

makes things clearer to us
