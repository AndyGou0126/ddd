page 198 in many businesses accounts are

kept by machines and the records are

photographed when there are millions of

different facts to be taken into account

and records of them to be made machines

can work far more quickly than people

the newest and greatest accounting

machines can do far more work in a

minute than the quickest human could do

in a year but the machines and the

questions put to them come out of human

minds and are controlled by us

peach $1.99 it was James Watt who in

1788 invented the fly ball governor for

steam engines as a way of making the

engine able to keep control over its own

rate of motion this was the invention

which made the steam engine a safe

machine the two balls are kept flying

round and round by the motion of the

engine as it goes more quickly they fly

farther out and this shuts down the

supply of steam coming to the engine

from the boiler when the engine goes

more slowly the balls fly lower and this

opens up the shutoff valve and lets more

steam through the pipe to the engine

page 200 the governor of a steam engine

took its name from the fact that it

governs the engine as a government

governs a country a government in a free

country is a group of men and women to

whom the people give the power to govern

them in free countries there is

government of the people by the people

for the good of the people

the government is the instrument by

which the country controls itself in a

free country the people can change the

government they can take the power away

from one group and give it to another

and there is a limit to the powers that

any government is given or can take

page 201 in a free country the men and

women in the government are dependent

upon the people and responsible to them

for the use made of the power which has

been given them in any good system of

government there must be ways of

controlling and limiting the amount of

power anyone has as the fly ball

governor controls and limits the output

of the steam engine

one of the chief controls over the power

of a government is the law of a country

the law is a body of statements about

what may be done - or by any person in

free countries all people are equal

under the law which they are responsible

for keeping to help them to keep it

there are police and judges

peach - OH - our bodies govern

themselves in many ways but we have to

control them consciously - we have to be

their judges and police when necessary

been in a well governed country there is

little work for police and judges a good

education develops the power of people

to govern themselves in more and more

complex ways as population increases and

as people become more responsible for

meeting their needs on a larger and

larger scale machines become more

important as the facts become more

complex machines are being used more and

more to do all sorts of measuring

counting and controlling can machines

think in a sense yes in another sense no

they can answer a question if we have

built into them the power to answer that

sort of question

page 203 we can make machines work for

us but machines cannot tell us what that

work should be it is people who are

responsible for the direction of the

work a person has to know not only how

to do things but whether to do them and

when a machine has only to do what it is

made to do free men and women have to

make up their own minds about all

important questions how does one learn

to do this by being with talking to and

watching others who are able to think

for themselves one may see how to think

for oneself one gets better at it by

trying education in this cannot start

too early

page 204 how do people come by their

ideas about what is better and what is

worse about what things are important in

life

what unimportant how do they judge

between things we have grown to what we

are out of the past we have come a very

long way through change and growth from

the first living cells all living things

however simple control themselves to

some degree many cannot be said to have

ideas but they have Direction within

limits

they have self-control

page 205 thinking is the most complex

sort of self-control and our brains with

which we think are the most complex

systems of feedback the thermostat and

the fly ball governor are about the

simplest of them in feedback systems

effects control their causes in the

thermostat feedback circle the effect of

increased input of fuel is increased

output of heat this effect feeds back

through the thermostat and cuts down the

input of fuel when the increase becomes

too great in the fly ball governor

circle the effect of more steam is more

output of work from the engine this

effect feeds back through the governor

and cuts down the steam when the engine

goes too fast in the brain millions of

feedback circles are always controlling

one another

page 206 our past is a very small part

of all time but it is a very important

part how old are the stars how old are

the Sun and the earth and the moon

nobody knows for certain it is not

possible at present to be certain about

such great questions as these but two

things seem probable the universe is

about five billion years old it has been

becoming more and more complex from the

start

page 207 however we try to think of time

it seems certain that the earth is older

than our minds can take in things have

been going on for a longer time then we

can think of and they will go on and on

through a longer time in the future than

we can think of seventy years seems a

long lifetime if compared with the

present minute but if compared with the

age of a stone it seems no time at all

there is a Chinese poem which says

quickly the years fly pass forever here

forever is this spring morning

peach 208 we have to think of time and

space together here and now there and

then we cannot see with our eyes how far

off in time and space the stars are but

astronomers can measure their distances

their unit of measure is the light here

the distance light travels through space

in a year the greatest telescopes of

today let us look to trillion light

years out into space the stars we see

there are 2 trillion light years away we

see them as they were 2 trillion years

ago we are looking into the past

peach 209 let this curving line

represent growth from simple to complex

in the world in this picture the past is

to the left and we men and women of

today are at the top of the curve long

long ago the only sorts of changes that

took place were so scientists a very

simple in comparison with the changes

which are taking place in you now as you

read this the curve represents the

change from simple to complex the higher

it goes the more complex are the sorts

of changes which are taking place

page 210 in the beginning as long ago as

far back in the past as we can talk

about the only sorts of changes which

took place I anticipate and here is

water turning into ice here are clouds

forming and rain falling these are

physical changes

page 211 much later other sorts of

changes more complex and these begin to

take place here is a lighted candle as

it burns the heat melts the candle and

the liquid goes up into the flame where

it is turned into gas so far all is

physical but in the flame chemical

changes take place carbon from the

candle and oxygen from the air come

together to make carbon dioxide at the

same time water is given off as you may

see if you hold a glass cover over the

flame the cover quickly becomes clouded

with little drops of water this water

was not in the wax and the candle flame

gives it off however dry the air is

the water and carbon dioxide come into

being through the chemical exchanges

between the lighted candle in the air

which make the flame at the same time

there are physical changes taking place

the top of the candle is melting and the

liquid fuel is moving up into the flame

and being turned into gas air is coming

into the flame carbon dioxide and water

are moving up from it and heat and light

are being given out

peach 2:12 when you step on a scale the

scale goes down and the springs inside

it are pulled out and the pointer moves

to a mark

these changes are physical when you look

at the pointer to see what your weight

is rays of light come from it to your

eye and go through the lens in your eye

to a point on the retina

peach 2:13 in a camera rays of light

from whatever you are photographing make

an upside-down picture on the film so it

is inside your eye the pictures made on

the retina are upside down everything

going on so far has been physical but in

your retina more complex sorts of

changes now take place some of these are

chemical complex materials in the retina

go through chemical changes not very

unlike those that make photographs on

films and these changes caused other

much more complex sorts of changes in

the living cells of the retina

peach 2:14 these nerves which make us

able to see are an outgrowth from the

brain to the retina from the eye

impulses travel to the brain through the

living cells of the nerves there are as

many as a million separate telephone

lines in these nerves alone a train of

changes goes up these nerves to the back

part of the brain the cells there let us

see the things that our eyes are looking

at no one at present has any idea of how

they do this the distance from the eye

to the back of the brain is not great

but some distances from some parts of

the body to the brain are long the rate

at which impulses travel through the

nerves is about the same for all of them

pitch 215 the distance from one stow to

one's brain and back maybe as much as 12

feet when you are feeling with your toe

for a step to put your weight on the

impulses have to go up your nerves from

your toe to your brain and back down

again to the muscles which move your

foot when you are walking almost all the

muscles in your body are at work keeping

you from falling down your muscles and

nerves work together to keep you on your

feet these changes in the nerve and

muscle cells are dependent on what is

going on in other cells in the body in

many different ways

peach 2:16 life on earth began it is

thought about two billion years ago no

one knows for certain whether there are

living things on other planets on the

red planet Mars for example or on any of

the 10 million million planets like the

earth which are now thought to be

traveling around other stars which are

like our Sun it seems possible even

probable that there are living beings on

many of them changes of color on Mars

are seen at different times of the

Martian year these changes may be caused

by the growth of plants the newest and

highest development of living things on

earth is human life about a million

years ago early men and women were

beginning something new in the long

story of the earth

page 217 let us change our time scale

and make this line represent 500,000

years the time since human life began

then this curve may represent the next

great steps forward into more complex

ways of living no one knows for certain

when speech began probably speech

developed slowly and in different ways

and at different times with different

sorts of people but certainly it was

through being able to speak to one

another that we became human with the

growth of language a great development

of the parts of the brain which are used

in talking took place speech gave us

greater and greater control over the

world over others and over ourselves

without language we would not have

become what we mean by the word human

peach 218 let us change our time scale

again and make our line represent 10,000

years the next great upward turn of our

curve came some 2,500 years ago in many

different parts of the earth people were

discovering then their first full and

clear ideas of themselves and of their

world in Greece the great poem The Iliad

and Socrates and Plato in Palestine Amos

Hosea and Isaiah you may not make for

yourself an image of anything in the sky

or on earth or in the waters under the

earth

page 219 in India Gotama Buddha and the

bhagavad-gita in China Confucius and

mensches at first through the spoken

word and then in writing we begin to

make for ourselves pictures of ourselves

and of what we should become more than

some No

we have been living by these pictures

ever since if you have read this book up

to this point you can easily read for

yourself the wrath of Achilles in simple

English the Republic of Plato in simple

English and the books of Amos Hosea and

Isaiah in the Bible in basic English

page 220 here are some of the greatest

scenes of all time which in one language

or another go on living in people's

minds for many centuries school children

in China began to learn to read with

this sentence human nature is good

mensches from the chung-yong what makes

us is named our nature what directs our

nature is named the way what makes the

way possible is education

page 221 from the Barada ronica upon

Ishod yacht sanaka said you cannot see

the seer of seen it or hear the hearer

of hearing or think the thinker of

thought or know the knower this is self

your own self lives in the hearts of all

from the apology of Socrates I do

nothing men of Athens but go about

telling you young and old not to care

for your bodies or your property so much

as for your souls Socrates was speaking

to the Athenians who were making up

their minds to put him to death Socrates

was the first man to talk of the soul in

the sense in which we have used the word

since then

page 222 at first writing seems to have

been chiefly a way of keeping records

the first great poems the Iliad for

example we're in the minds of mouths of

poet after poet before they were written

down the teachings of Buddha of mensches

Confucius and the earlier Hebrews were

given first by the spoken word and

written down later by some who heard

them

Socrates though we use books thought

that teaching should be by word of mouth

and by example and Jesus taught only by

what he said and did and was later the

written word was to become the chief

instrument through which we could try to

understand ourselves and our world

peach 2:23 it is chiefly through reading

and through thought about what we read

that we come to see how our ideas depend

on one another very much as we are

dependent upon others or as organs and

our bodies are interdependent through

reading and reflection we can learn to

know ourselves reflect for a while on

these words of Shakespeare thinking he

says turns not to itself till it has

traveled and is mirrored there where it

may see itself some very good students

of Shakespeare think that he wrote

married not mirrored in line 110

peach 224 every idea with which we

reflect is what it is and can do what it

can do only because our other organs of

thought are what they are and do their

own work the parts of this bridge do

what they do only because the other

parts of it are there and are doing

their work and this is equally true of

the words in a language every word is

able to work as it does only because

other words work with it in every step

we take what any of our muscles can do

depends on what our other muscles are

doing and all this is possible only

because our nerve cells are in control

and nerve cells can work together well

only if the blood is serving them well

page 225 and the blood can serve them

well only if the heart is in good order

and if the lungs are taking in enough

oxygen and the heart and lungs in turn

are dependent on the food the stomach

can give the blood stream and on the

control the nervous system can keep up

over all the organs of the body

peach to 26 but in fact the organization

of our bodies is far more complex than

this short and simple account can say in

everything we do every breath we take

every motion we make from the directing

of our eyes as we look to the wording of

a sentence as we write billions of cells

of every sort in our bodies are working

together serving one another it is the

same with us in our world any great

question coming up in any part of the

world today has its effect on almost

everyone anywhere as with the body

damage in any part is damaging to all

the rest the more we reflect upon this

the more we will understand why world

organization is important we are far

more dependent upon one another than we

know what to do what to do said

Confucius in truth I do not know what to

do with a man who does not ask himself

this wise people go on asking themselves

what to do all their lives it is two

questions one what should I want to be

or to become what is our end or purpose

we have seen how far we have come where

are we going - how can I best work to

this end

page 227 everything said Aristotle has

its own true work or purpose the work it

can do best the work which is right for

it a good wheel turns well a good knife

cuts well a good clock keeps time well a

good apple tree gives good fruit a good

cow gives good milk in the body I hand

foot each has its own work to do what

can we do best what is our own work as a

person is it to learn to learn what is

it to learn what to do how does one

learn is it by the feedback from the

effects of what one does is it by seen

from the outcome whether one is doing

the right thing

page 228 if you are trying to draw a

circle the curved line you have made

keeps telling you how to go on you can

learn to draw better by trying if you

are making a speech

what will you go on to say depends on

what you have said up to that point and

upon the people listening to you a bad

speaker is one of whom this is not true

a good speaker has learned by experience

how to design a speech and how to change

the design if necessary in speaking as

in everything we do the way we begin

depends upon what our purpose is upon

what we are trying to do but we are not

always nor need we be fully conscious of

what that purpose is sometimes in

reflection we see more purpose than we

knew in what we did

peach 229 how you start your circle

depends on how large it is to be so

there is feed-forward as well as

feedback feed-forward is as widely

supported a fact as feedback any number

of examples can be found there can be no

feedback without feed-forward knowledge

of what you have done and are doing will

not help you unless there is direction

and what you were trying to do you may

not fully know what this direction is

you may be trying to find out what it is

as the development of the microscope has

increased our power to see so the

development of instruments of thought is

increasing our power to design and

direct and see what we are doing

page 230 in every sentence you write the

feedback from the letters of any word

you were writing together with your

knowledge of the spelling of the word

tells you which letter to write next but

feedback can do this only because you

fed forward that word and no other has

the word you would write and in writing

any sentence feedback from the words you

have written

can tell you what to write next only

because you fed forward that sentence

fed forward that sentence only because

of a more general feed-forward the

purpose of the paragraph in which the

sentence is to take part and the

paragraph to depends upon the chapter

and the chapter on the book general what

does this word mean each of these

circles as they go out from you

represents a more general idea than all

that is within

page 231 every breath we take is

controlled by feed-forward and feedback

if you want to be heard at the back of

the room you take a deeper breath as you

speak and why do you want to be heard

what part does what you have to say

taking your larger purposes and in the

larger purpose is still in which you

take part before life came up out of the

sea it seems probable that there was no

free oxygen or carbon dioxide in what is

now the air the gas is necessary for

life on land were put into the air

scientists think little by little by

living things themselves

what overall purpose is there of which

all our purposes are parts here is a

rough copy of one of the greatest works

of William Blake it represents design at

work beginning to give order to the

world

page 232 John Amos Comenius was so far

as we know the first man to use pictures

in books written for beginning readers

and for beginners in a second language

he was to have been the first head of

Harvard College where this book is being

written but could not come cominius

began his reader Orbis pictus with this

picture the teacher is saying come boy

learn to be wise and the boy asks what

does this mean to be wise the teacher

answers to understand rightly to do

rightly and to speak out rightly all

that is necessary

peach 233 the teacher gives the boy an

answer though he knows that no one can

become wise all in a minute all our

lives through we go on learning how to

understand rightly to do what is right

and to speak out at the right time see

the size of the question the boy is

asking in this book we have not tried to

give any answers but only to bring

together some of the more important

ideas and facts needed if we are to ask

ourselves what we should know and think

and feel and desire and do to have been

wise is to have known thought felt

desired and done as was best but there

are many different ways of knowing

thinking feeling desiring and doing

which are the best that is the question

our lives are our attempts to find an

answer and language is the most

important of all our instruments for

this purpose
