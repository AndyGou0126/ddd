page 122 living things are made up of

cells and cells do not grow to be more

than twice the size they were at first

but trees can grow to be many thousands

of times the size they were as seeds the

tallest known tree is three hundred

sixty-four feet high one great tree in

California is as much as 115 feet round

its trunk at the thickest point how does

such growth take place as cells do not

grow to be more than twice as large as

they were at first it all takes place

through division the cells which make up

the organism are able to divide into two

and this division goes on and on when

you were born you had as many as 200

billion cells in your body all coming in

9 months from the division of one cell

170 fifth of an inch across

page 123 all organisms which you see in

the world about you have grown by cell

division you and I have become what we

are through billions of divisions in the

cells whose outcome is our cell

structure at this minute in cell

division the two halves of the cell as

you see in picture four become ready to

separate in picture five you see that

they have separated the cell in picture

one by division has become two separate

cells the daughter cells do in every way

the same as their mother cell did one of

the greatest question scientists are

working on is what keeps the daughter

cells doing what they have to do

page 124 even the simplest living

organism is far more complex than any

machines the people have made organisms

are build up of parts which are

themselves more complex than any machine

and these parts in turn are the most

complex things the science of chemistry

knows it is because they are so complex

that they can work together in an

organism in so many different ways

chemistry is about the different ways in

which different materials are built up

for example water is made up of oxygen

and hydrogen United in a way which may

be represented like this carbon dioxide

is made up of carbon and oxygen in a way

which may be represented like this

chemists make use of the formula h2o for

water in their writing they use formulas

to represent the structure of all

material things

page 125 the most important of the

materials in our bodies are the proteins

among them are materials with the most

complex structures known to the chemist

we can get some idea of how complex

proteins are by comparing the formula

for one of them with the formula for

water or for carbon dioxide compare this

formula for a protein from milk with the

simple formulas for water or carbon

dioxide the letter and in this formula

represents nitrogen and the letter S

represents sulphur

peach 1:26 there may be as many as

100,000 different sorts of proteins in

the human body at working as many

different ways it is a protein in our

blood which takes up oxygen from the air

we breathe into our lungs and carries it

to the cells which need it it is another

protein which makes our bones strong and

another which makes our muscles able to

pull on and move our bones it is other

proteins in our hair and skin and nails

which make them what they are others

again do very important work in the

digestion of food in controlling other

changes in the body in keeping it

healthy and in making children become so

surprisingly like their parents

page 127 how do these very complex

materials come into being the answer is

through the work of plants plants need

sunlight this is common knowledge within

the experience of most of us but you can

show how true it is if you make this

little experiment

grow two bean seeds over glasses of

water starting them in a dark cupboard

after a few days take one glass out into

the daylight and keep the other in the

dark compare the two from time to time

you will find that it is the plant in

the light which grows a strong stem and

green leaves

eh 128 in 1772 the Englishman Joseph

Priestley the discoverer of oxygen made

a most important experiment he knew from

experience that air is necessary to

plants and animals he knew that if you

put a live mouse for example under a

glass so that no fresh air can come to

it the mouse in a short time will die it

will have taken all the oxygen out of

the air and without oxygen it cannot go

on living Priestley put a green plant

under a large glass cover standing in

water so that no fresh air could get in

he thought that in a little while he

would find the plant dead like the mouse

page 129 but no here is what he said

when it had gone on growing there for

some months I found that the year would

neither put out a candle

nor was it bad for a mouse which I put

into it in other words the green plant

had not used up all the oxygen in the

air the next step was taken when a Dutch

scientist found that Priestley's

experiment would not work without light

in the light a plant gives out oxygen

and builds up sugars and other complex

materials in itself in the dark it gives

out carbon dioxide and water

page 130 the material which makes plants

green is necessary if they are to use

energy from light for healthy growth

unlike animals plants can take what they

need straight from the air and earth and

water in which they live through their

green leaves and stems they separate h

from h2o and unite it with co2 to make

carbohydrates structure of part of a

carbohydrate a sugar this power of

plants is named photosynthesis people

and animals depend upon photosynthesis

and plants to supply their food and

energy we and the animals either eat

plants or eat plant eating animals or

both

page 131 when we think it out we can see

that most of the energy we use comes

from the Sun by way of the materials

which plants build up in photosynthesis

scientists know only a little so far

about photosynthesis it is only a little

more than a hundred years since the

first account of it was given by the

German scientists von Mayer but with

more experimenting being done every year

much more will certainly be known before

very long the rate at which scientific

knowledge is increasing is going up all

the time in time it may even be possible

to use the energy of light itself in

industry to do in our factories

something like what plants do in their

green cells

peach 132 before long we may learn from

working on photosynthesis how to make or

grow more food as we have seen more than

1 billion people on this planet are

short of food as more and more people

are born the need for new food supplies

will increase it may be that we can find

what we want in the sea it is thought

that as much as 90% of the

photosynthesis which takes place in the

world goes on in microscopic water

plants in the sea maybe much of the food

people are going to need in the future

will come out of the oceans or making

food straight from complexes of carbon

hydrogen and oxygen may become a great

new industry at present we have to get

most of the energy used in industry by

burning coal and oil and other fuels

peach 133 this energy is the sun's

energy stored up long ago by plants coal

comes from the dead bodies of plants

stored away from the air and under

pressure through millions of years in

great beds in the earth the amount of

coal and oil in the earth is it is true

very great but the amount we're using

today is great to a time may come before

long when we will have used up all of

the coal and oil that is easy to get at

we have been taking oil out of the earth

only since about 1860 without oil there

would be no cars and no airplanes it is

strange to think that airplanes depend

on what plants were doing millions of

years ago

peach 134 plants and animals all need

air only about one fifth of the air is

oxygen the other 4/5 is another gas

without taste smell or color named

nitrogen both plants and animals need

nitrogen as well as oxygen but they

cannot take it from the air themselves

how did they get their supply of

nitrogen there are very small organisms

in soil and water which can take

nitrogen out of the air and fix it in

complex materials which plants and

animals can use these materials are

taken up by plants through their roots

in water from the soil animals get their

nitrogen by eating plants some of this

nitrogen comes away in animal waste and

people have for many thousands of years

known enough to put animal waste back

into the soil to help plants grow

page 135 nitrogen like carbon oxygen and

hydrogen is used over and over again in

support of life plans build nitrogen up

into complex structures animals eat the

plants then animal waste and dead plants

and fallen leaves are broken down into

simpler forms again so the great round

goes on without end all made possible

only by energy coming from the Sun

scientists say that all the oxygen and

all the carbon dioxide now in the air

have been put there after used by plants

through photosynthesis

page 136 all organisms it is clear have

a number of needs in common of which air

water food and the sun's light and heat

are the chief but people have many other

needs though we may not think of them as

needs one of them our need for other

people is very important first of all we

need other people to do things for us

when we are very young or very old or

when we are ill we need others to take

care of us

we need their help we need them to do

things for us which we cannot do for

ourselves we need their love

page 137 every hour of our lives we do

things that are possible only because of

work which is done for us by other

people who grew the cotton who made the

sheets who watched the Sheep who washed

the wool who made the blankets for the

bed you sleep in his work are you using

when you turn on the light who mined the

coal which gives the power to heat and

light your room

but equally men and women need to do

things for other people most people are

not happy if they are not in some way

helping others doing things for others

they need someone to love

peach 1:38 all our lives we need other

people in many parts of the world

families do everything for themselves

until the 19th century this was true

almost everywhere outside the cities

families were self-supporting they grew

the food they needed built their own

houses and made their own clothing and

furniture the candles were lighting the

rooms at night and the plows and carts

for work on the farm by day in every way

they took care of themselves living like

this a family is very like a simple

organism

pH 139 but a family living in a city

today is more like a cell in a complex

organism other people whom it does not

know do almost everything for it workers

and factories make the things it needs

and send them to the stores which sell

them to it other people teach its

children in schools and take care of

them in hospitals when they are ill

police and fire stations keep watch over

the city lighting and water supplies the

clearing away of waste the upkeep of

streets and roads are all public

services in exchange for all this each

of us does our own sort of work our

daily round whatever it is this is true

for most of us if not all

page 140 people need plays well as work

though if your interest is deep enough

work and play can be the same thing to

some people all their best work is a

sort of play they get so much pleasure

from it and are so interested in it that

they work when they don't need to they

are doing what they want most to do it

was the philosopher Plato who said all

learning is best done his play

nothing learned under pressure takes

root rightly in the mind so let

children's work be a sort of play

page 141 people need work and play for

the body and for the mind dating music

and dancing rest and change they need

books and talk with others with old

friends as well as with new people they

need new knowledge to keep their old

knowledge clear and living a friend is

someone you know and love and with whom

you have much in common people you know

only a little are not your friends in

this sense though they may become your

friends if you get to know them better

pitch 142 people need to see beautiful

things and have beautiful things about

them drawing goes back very far into our

past the drawings of animals copied on

this page may have been made as early as

25,000 BC

peach 143 drawing can help to make ideas

easier the pictures drawn in this book

for example but the greatest drawing and

painting and sculpture can make our

highest powers come into play

the drawings below are of two pieces of

sculpture one from India and the other

from Africa

page 144 we need to hear beautiful

things music may go back still farther

in time than the other arts banan

happily we have no records of music

before the discovery of writing as with

language the writing of music may have

started with pictures today not only do

we have ways of writing down music but

we can make copies of the sound of music

as it is played

page 145 we need to make beautiful

things today the great cities of the

world have public art galleries and

museums where anyone may see the

paintings and drawings and sculpture of

artists through the centuries

page 146 great cities have theaters

where place of the past and the present

are acted they have music buildings

where great works of music are played

they have libraries where the best that

has been thought and written can be

found art and music and poetry come out

of our greatest hours with ourselves and

give others some of their greatest hours

page 147 we need to be alone sometimes

to get to know ourselves better though

we need to be with other people too to

get to know them better and ourselves

through them the more we know one

another the better able we will be to

live together in the world the nations

on the earth the Chinese the Indians the

British the Russians the Germans the

Americans the French and the others know

very little about one another they look

in different directions and have

different ideas of themselves and of the

world they live in different worlds this

is good only if they have bridges

between their separate worlds and get to

know enough about each other

page 148 a little knowledge about other

nations to little knowledge can make

them seem bad but we can't turn the

clock back to yesterday when nations

could keep to themselves and live

without any knowledge of or help from

other countries the thing to do now is

to get more knowledge about other

peoples and knowledge of other languages

is necessary for this we need many more

people with the deep knowledge of other

languages than their own we have to know

a language well if we are to know what

people who use it mean and think

page 149 in English as in any other

language we do not always say what we

mean or mean what we say this is true of

some of the things we say every day for

example how do you do how are you this

is what people say on meeting sometimes

they stop and shake hands how are you

looks like a question it is written with

a question mark after it and sometimes

how are you is a question one person may

want to know if another is well or ill

how their health is and so on

peach 150 when these are questions

they're almost always said as if the

person who says them means them as

questions and wants an answer but most

of the time they are set in a way which

does not ask for any answer when these

words are said so we do not answer I am

tired

or I have a bad cold or I am NOT well we

stayed the same thing back to the other

person how are you or hello such words

are like a smile or a wave of the hand

in the same way when we meet someone in

the morning we may say good morning the

weather may be very bad but we say good

morning and the other person will say

good morning back to us we are not

talking about the weather or about how

good or bad the morning is

page 151 again when people are partying

they may say good morning or good

afternoon or good evening or good night

to one another in place of goodbyes they

are not talking about the weather

but saying may all be well with you at

this time you will find few people today

who know that goodbye is a short way of

saying God be with you but in times past

when religion had more place than it now

has an education a child could be taught

this very young as part of a knowledge

of English

page 152 there was a teacher who tried

to teach all this her students seemed to

take in what she taught them they said

back to her all together when you say

good morning to us we say good morning

to you next morning on her way to school

she saw one of them coming she said to

herself now I will see if he has learned

that point about good morning so she

said to the young man good morning yes

it is she had said good morning to him

with a question in her mind will he say

good morning she had asked a question

and he had answered it the teacher said

to herself I must have seen to be asking

a question so he gave me an answer next

time I will do better at that minute she

saw another student coming she said to

herself let me try again

peach 153 so she gave the young man a

friendly smile and said good morning

thank you very much what was wrong then

the teacher asked herself I must have

said it as if I were giving him

something that was why he thanked me

next time I must keep that out of my

voice she saw a third student coming

this time she wanted the answer good

morning

so much that her voice became hard and

sharp good morning please you see how

little one person may know what is in

another's mind even when the other is

trying to show him

page 154 when people are from very

different countries with very different

ways it can be hard for them to

understand one another not very long ago

the number of people who knew anything

about people in other countries was very

small few people went far from home or

took much interest in other countries

today all this has changed every day we

hear more and more about other countries

and about how bad their governments are

they hear about the strange and wrong

ideas other countries have of them if we

knew them better we would see that

people everywhere are very much like

ourselves not very good or very bad but

in between and able to become better or

worse than they are our minds are as

like one another as our bodies are

page 155 we say the earth is getting

smaller it is the same size as it was

but we can go about it more and more

easily many more people travel outside

their own countries every year we can

get news today from any part of the

world in a few seconds though we may not

always understand it many more ideas

right or wrong about other countries are

in people's minds most of this interest

in other nations and places is good if

it goes deep enough we need to know more

if we can keep our heads on our

shoulders the wider knowledge and

experience which are coming will help

the world to better days

peach 156 the earth seems to be getting

smaller because our experience is

getting wider all sorts of new ways of

living and new ways of doing things have

come to us in the last 50 years stranger

things are coming people can travel

today through space to the moon though

only a very small number of them have

done so the price is too high for most

countries to send even one person there

for the present what is space that is

hard to say it is equally hard to say

what time is we in the Sun and the moon

and the stars are all in space and time

but no one understands what space and

time are not even the best philosophers

are clear about them

page 157 these two men know that they

have a space between them without being

able to say what space is there is not

enough space in this car for all these

travelers they know that this is so

though they cannot say what space is

there is more free space on this page

then on some other pages of the book

which take longer to read

page 158 it is equally hard to say what

time is this man has time on his hands

this other man has not enough time for

his reading the same amount of time may

seem very short to one person and very

long to another a person's sense of time

changes as their feelings change some

days go by much more quickly than others

some hours seem as if they would never

end

some are passed before they seem to have

begun most people find that time goes by

more quickly the older they get

peach 159 our ideas about space and time

are changing today we can fly around the

world in 24 hours or less the earth

turns round on itself in 24 hours a

person in an airplane flying West at

1,000 miles an hour would see the earth

turning the Sun would seem to be in the

same place in the sky the earth would

turn below the airplane 200 years ago

scientists thought that the world was

only about 6,000 years old now

scientists say that it is nearer 6

billion years old and that humans are at

least 500,000 years old but we have been

able to fly only in the last 100 years

the invention of the airplane is an

invention of the 20th century
